a1,Forever In Love,"

Love leads to laughter 
Love leads to pain 
With you by my side 
I feel good times again 
 
Never have I felt these feelings before 
You showed me the world 
How can I ask for more? 
 
And although there's confusion 
We'll find a solution to keep my heart close to you 
 
And I know, yes I know 
If you hold me, believe me 
I'll never, never ever leave 
 
And I know 
There is nothing that I would not do for you 
Forever be true 
And I know 
Although times can be hard 
We will see it through 
I'm forever in love with you 
 
Show me affection 
In all different ways 
Give you my heart 
For the rest of my days 
 
With you all my troubles are left far behind  
Like heaven on earth 
When I look in your eyes 
 
And although there's confusion 
We'll find a solution 
To keep my heart close to you 
 
And I know, yes I know 
If you hold me, believe me 
I'll never, never ever leave 
 
And I know 
There is nothing that I would not do for you 
Forever be true 
And I know 
Although times can be hard 
We will see it through 
I'm forever in love with you 
 
No need to cry 
I'll be right by your side 
(Right by your side) 
 
Let's take our time 
Love won't run dry 
If you hold me, believe me 
I'll never, never ever leave 
 
And I know 
There is nothing that I would not do for you 
Forever be true 
And I know 
Although times can be hard 
We will see it through 
I'm forever in love 
And I know 
There is nothing that I would not do for you 
 
Forever be true 
And I know 
 
Oh I know 
Although times can be hard 
We will see it through 
I'm forever in love with you

"
a1,Everytime,"

Lately, I'm not who I used to be 
Someone's come and taken me 
Where I don't wanna go 
If I knew 
Exactly what I have to do 
In order to be there for you 
When you are feeling low 
And all the things we ever wanted 
Were once yours and mine 
Now I know we can revive it 
All the love we left 
 
Every time I kiss 
I feel your lips 
And every time I cry 
I see you smile 
And every time I close my eyes 
I realize 
That every time I hold 
Your hand in mine 
The sweetest thing my heart 
Could ever find 
And I have never felt this way 
Since the day 
I gave your love away 
 
Save me 
I've fallen from my destiny 
You and I were meant to be 
I've thrown it all away 
Now you're gone 
It's time for me to carry on 
But baby I just can't go on 
Without you by my side 
And all the things we ever wanted 
Were once yours and mine 
Now I know we can revive it 
All the love we left 
 
Every time I kiss 
I feel your lips 
And every time I cry 
I see you smile 
And every time I close my eyes 
I realize 
That every time I hold 
Your hand in mine 
The sweetest thing my heart 
Could ever find 
And I have never felt this way 
Since the day 
I gave your love away 
 
We can survive it 
All the pain we feel inside 
You relied on me 
And now I've let you down 
Now I promise you forever 
I will be the best I can 
Now I know we can revive it 
All the love we left 
 
Every time I kiss 
I feel your lips 
And every time I cry 
I see you smile 
And every time I close my eyes 
I realize 
That every time I hold 
Your hand in mine 
The sweetest thing my heart 
Could ever find 
And I have never felt this way 
Since I gave your love away 
 
Every time I kiss 
I feel your lips 
And every time I cry 
I see you smile 
And every time I close my eyes 
I realize 
That every time I hold 
Your hand in mine 
The sweetest thing my heart 
Could ever find 
And I have never felt this way 
Since the day 
I gave your love away
"
a1,If Only,"

I said I'd never leave you 
I said that I would never let you down 
I needed a chance to prove my love to you 
'Til time is through 
 
The promises I gave you 
I never meant to see them left untrue 
You were my everything, I give my 
Heart to you - to start anew 
 
And all of the days just pass me by 
So I pray, and I'm asking why 
 
All that I ask is one more try 
'Cause I never wanna say goodbye 
 
If only I listened to my heart 
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart 
Now all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do 
If only we two could start anew 
I promise I'd never be untrue 
'Cause all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do 
 
You're looking for another 
I'm looking for a chance with you again 
I guess I never showed you 
What you mean to me 
Can't you see 
 
Everything I told you 
And everything I did I feel was wrong 
I didn't know the words I said would 
Make you leave, please believe 
 
And all of the days just pass me by 
So I pray, and I'm asking why 
 
All that I ask is one more try 
'Cause I never wanna say goodbye 
 
If only I listened to my heart 
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart 
Now all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do 
If only we two could start anew 
I promise I never be untrue 
'Cause all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do 
 
If only, if only, if only, all I do 
If only, if only, if only, all I do 
 
If only I listened to my heart 
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart 
Now all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do 
 
If only I listened to my heart 
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart 
Now all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do 
If only we two could start anew 
I promise I'd never be untrue 
'Cause all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do 
 
If only I listened to my heart 
Then maybe we wouldn't be apart 
Now all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do 
If only we two could start anew 
I promise I never be untrue 
'Cause all I can dream about is you 
And baby that's all I do

a1,Like A Rose,"

And as I look into your eyes 
I see an angel in disguise 
Sent from God above for me to love 
To hold and idolize 
And as I hold your body near 
I'll see this month through to a year 
And then forever on 'til life is gone 
I'll keep your loving near 
 
And now I've finally found my way 
To lead me down this lonely road 
All I have to do is follow you 
To lighten off my load 
 
You treat me like a rose 
You give me room to grow 
You shone the light of love on me 
And gave me air so I can breathe 
You open doors that close 
In a world where anything goes 
You give me strength so I stand tall 
Within this bed of earth 
Just like a rose 
 
And when I feel like hope is gone 
You give me strength to carry on 
Each time I look at you there's something new 
To keep our loving strong 
I hear you whisper in my ear 
All of the words I long to hear 
Of how you'll always be here next to me 
To wipe away my tears 
 
And now I've finally found my way 
To lead me down this lonely road 
All I have to do is follow you 
To lighten off my load 
 
You treat me like a rose 
You give me room to grow 
You shone the light of love on me 
And gave me air so I can breathe 
You open doors that close 
In a world where anything goes 
You give me strength so I stand tall 
Within this bed of earth 
Just like a rose 
 
And though the seasons change 
Our love remains the same 
(Just like a rose) 
You face the thunder 
When the sunshine turns to rain 
(Just like a rose) 
 
You treat me like a rose (You treat me like a rose) 
You give me room to grow (You give me room to grow) 
You shone the light of love on me 
And gave me air so I can breathe 
You open doors that close 
In a world where anything goes 
You give me strength so I stand tall 
Within this bed of earth 
Just like a rose 
 
Whoa, like a rose (Just like a rose) 
No, oh (ah) 
You treat me like a rose (Just like a rose) 
No no no no oh (ah ah ah ah) 
You give me strength so I stand tall 
Within this bed of earth 
Just like a rose
"
a1,Walking In The Rain,"

Sitting by the window 
Singing songs of love 
Wishing you were here 
Because the memory's not enough 
Wear my mask in silence 
Pretending I'm alright 
If you could see then you would be 
Here standing by my side 
 
It may be hard to believe 
But girl you're the only one I need 
It may be hard along the way 
It's this feeling I get 
When blue skies turn to grey 
 
Feels like I'm walking in the rain 
I find myself trying to wash away the pain 
'Cause I need you to give me some shelter 
'Cause I'm fading away 
And baby, I'm walking in the rain 
 
Every single hour 
Of every single day 
I need to cry, my eyes are dry 
I've cried my tears away 
Can't help but remember 
How you made me feel 
You dressed my soul and made me whole 
You made my life complete 
 
It may be hard to believe 
But girl you're the only one I need 
It may be hard along the way 
It's this feeling I get 
When blue skies turn to grey 
 
Feels like I'm walking in the rain 
I find myself trying to wash away the pain 
'Cause I need you to give me some shelter 
'Cause I'm fading away 
And baby, I'm walking in the rain 
 
Of all we've said and done 
Remains the memories of days 
When life was fun 
But now when you are gone 
I sit alone to watch the setting of the sun 
 
Feels like I'm walking in the rain 
I find myself trying to wash away the pain 
'Cause I need you to give me some shelter 
'Cause I'm fading away 
And baby, I'm walking in the rain 
 
I said baby, I'm walking in the rain

a1,Still Around,"

In this life of uncertainty 
There are people that we all need 
Someone to face you, with no disguise 
In you there's a remedy 
That makes everyday seem trouble free 
No distance and no device 
 
'Cause you hear the words 
When no one understands 
 
When my world has come undone 
And I've lost my setting sun 
When all I see are clouds 
You're still around 
When I fall into a tear 
Inspirations disappear 
You clear away that doubt 
'Cause you're still, you're still around 
 
Now I've stumbled on uncertainty 
Never thought this could ever be 
No contradictions left inside 
When I feel the rain come my way 
You give me sun, you're my brighter day 
Intuition's telling me to stay 
 
'Cause you hold the words 
When nothing's left to say 
 
When my world has come undone 
And I've lost my setting sun 
When all I see are clouds 
You're still around 
When I fall into a tear 
Inspirations disappear 
You clear away that doubt 
'Cause you're still, you're still around 
 
In this life of uncertainty 
There are people that we all need

a1,I Still Believe,"

The sun went down so long ago 
I watched you cry I had to go 
Forever only lasted just a day 
And now without you by my side 
The visions of a lonely life 
Take me to a dream in a place so far away 
 
I see an angel and I think of you 
I watch her hide behind a smile 
And then I think of what I have to do 
If only I had listened for a while 
 
I still believe, I still believe 
A love so strong will carry on 
You know there's so much to be seen 
I still believe, I still believe 
It's not the end, let's start again 
I still believe 
 
The emptiness of what could be 
Shows everything you mean to me 
It started out a game I'd never played 
If I defy the foolish pride 
And find that place so deep inside 
Take me to my dream, I know I have to stay 
 
I see a rainbow and I think of you 
Of what we had, of what we were 
And then I think of what I have to do 
If only I had listened for a while 
 
I still believe, I still believe 
A love so strong will carry on 
You know there's so much to be seen 
I still believe, I still believe 
It's not the end let's start again 
I still believe 
 
Everybody's always asking me why 
Why I did, what I did to make you cry 
Please believe me when I say what I say 
I didn't mean to go away 
At the time I couldn't stay 
 
I see an angel and she sees me too 
And as she wipes a teary eye 
I know exactly what I have to do 
To start a new beginning in my life 
 
I still believe, I still believe 
A love so strong will carry on 
You know there's so much to be seen 
I still believe, I still believe 
It's not the end let's start again 
I still believe 
You know I still believe 
 
It's not the end, let's start again 
I still believe

a1,Heaven By Your Side,"

You and I, cannot hide 
The love we feel inside 
The words we need to say 
I feel that I have always walked alone 
But now that you're here with me 
There'll always be a place that I can go 
 
Suddenly our destiny has 
Started to unfold 
When you're next to me, I can see 
The greatest story love has ever told 
 
Now my life is blessed with the love of an angel 
How can it be true? 
Somebody to keep the dream alive 
The dream I found in you 
I always thought that love would be the strangest thing to me 
But when we touch, I realize 
That I found my place in heaven by your side 
 
I could fly, when you smile 
I'd walk a thousand miles 
To hear you call my name 
Now that I have finally found the one 
Who will be there for me eternally 
My everlasting sun 
 
Suddenly our destiny has 
Started to unfold 
When you're next to me, I can see

"
a1,Same Old Brand New You,"

I can still remember the time you were there 
When I needed to hold you, feel you 
Every time I ask you to find a new way 
You lie a new way 
Is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 
 
You'll change 
You'll never change 
You're never never gonna keep your promises 
You'll change 
You'll never change 
You're never never gonna keep your promises 
 
You said you'd changed 
But I'm afraid 
It's something I won't live to see 
It seems so strange 
That sometimes fate 
Can appear to be so real 
And yet turn out to be a fantasy

You and me, we sit and talk of friendship then I ask 
If you can see, if we could be together forever 
I see the light die in your eyes 
'Cause you're scared you'll hurt 
So you don't wanna try 
 
Well take a chance and come home with me, you could stay for eternity 
If you try then at least you'll see 
Then you'll never regret the things we never did 
 
You turn to me, I see your eyes 
And somehow they cease to shine, you smile at me yet I can see 
You don't think we can make it 
You see the light die in my eyes 
'Cause I'm scared to lose you, I wish you would try 
 
Well take a chance and come home with me, you could stay for eternity 
If you try then at least you'll see 
Then you'll never regret the things we never did

Can this be? 
Is there something wrong with you and me? 
Guess we'll see 
I confess 
I don't know know how we got into this mess 
Might have guessed 
Day by day 
You're slowly running out of things to say 
So I may 
Ask you why, is it always me who has to try 
To make things feel right 
 
You never told me what you feel inside 
I thought you loved me now I realise 
No matter how I try 
You never seem to be 
Satisfied 
Now you're telling me it's 
 
Too bad baby that you're so good to me 
I like you, you love me 
Too bad baby you're so into me 
I can't breathe 
You fall in love too easily 
 
Too bad baby that you're so good to me

Too bad baby you're so into me 
I can't breathe 
You fall in love too easily 
 
Me and you 
Are slowly running out of things to do 
Nothing new, I don't know 
Why we don't agree 
When I say, ""Yes,"" you say, ""No"" 
Don't be shy 
Please tell me why it is that we don't see 
Eye to eye 
So confused 
I'm feeling helpless and I'm feeling used 
Like yesterdays news girl 
 
You never told me what you feel inside 
I thought you loved me now I realise 
No matter how I try 
You never seem to be 
Satisfied

Walk all over me I let her 
Friends who told me go and get her 
They're telling me forget her 
Too bad baby think I'm going crazy 
Someone take me nothing's gonna save me

We will always be this way 
Flying angels lifting high 
To reach the sun where I belong

Above the clouds I see you cry 
 
You know that when you smile 
You stop the rain (stop the rain) 
And we will be together 
Once again 
 
Although I'm gone remember me 
Please be strong

"
a1,She Doesn't See Me,"

When she passes me by, she's a ray of light 
Like the first drop of sun from the sky 
And I know she's a queen who deserves a king 
But I'm not a king 
And she doesn't see me 
 
When she dances she moves me to a smile 
I see everything near her shine 
There is a grace in her ways I can't contain 
I don't have that grace 
So she doesn't see me 
 
And the closer I get I can't help but hide 
So ashamed of my body and voice 
There are boundaries we pass in spite of the war 
But our own, we can't seem to cross 
 
He has a way that surrounds him, so delicate 
With a glory that reigns in his life 
He is also so much that he is not 
But these things they don't see 
And she doesn't see me 
 
There are things we can change if we just choose to fight 
But the walls of injustice are high 
 
When she passes me by, she's a ray of light 
Like the first drop of sun from the sky 
 
And I know shes a queen who deserves a king 
Someone other than me 
Different from me 
She doesn't see me 
She doesn't see me

What's your favorite scary movie? 
 
I've walked the jungle 
Fought a lion with bare hands 
The Prince of Darkness

I've crossed the desert 
Never feared for my own 
Where lightning strikes - I'll always go 
 
Eye of the tiger, not afraid to attack 
Left Frankenstein flat on his back 
That witch's magic, just ain't nothing to see 
'Cause you're the one who cast a spell onto me

You better look out, it's just begun 
There's something that I want you to know

I get the shivers down my spine 
Feel my body turning blue 
The feeling is so frightening 
It's driving me insane 
The one thing that I'm scared of... 
(Is losing hold of you)

I see that you're in love, I know it's not with me 
But I don't want the truth to haunt my memory 
 
It's never too late to relight the fire 
It never stopped burning for me 
The flame, it never died inside of me 
 
How is it now that I can tell you I love you? 
How is it only now that it's too late? 
What can I do? The love that we had is torn in two 
So you'll take the smiles from all of our years 
I'll take the tears 
 
I sit and reminisce, of times that we once shared 
You gave me more than love 
But never thought I cared 
My feelings were all for you 
Although it did not show 
I only told you on the day you let me go (oh, ho) 
 
It's never too late to relight the fire

So you'll take the smiles from all of our years 
And I'll take the tears

But I'm hoping the pain will heal in time 
Although you're leaving, I won't say goodbye 
Because I know you're here with me inside 
Now I'll be alive 
 
How is it now that I can tell you I love you? 
How is it only now that it's too late (to late, to late, baby)?

What can I do? The love that we had is torn in two 
So you'll take the smiles from all of our years 
And I 'll take the tears
"
a1,One In Love,"

Have you seen your sunset 
Fade beneath a rain cloud? 
Have you ever chased your dreams away? 
Did you ever think that 
Life was just a highway? 
A never-ending road of lonely days? 
 
There are times we cry 
And reach out to the sky 
For the strength we need 
To hold our head up high 
Oh 
 
All we have to do now 
Is love one another 
Sisters and brothers 
Can all live as one 
And all we have to do now 
Is show one another 
We all need each other 
To live as one in love 
 
Have you seen a sunrise 
Promising you daylight? 
When all you need is shelter from the storm 
Did you ever feel like 
Love was just an island 
You can't survive on love on your own ooh 
 
There are times when I 
Need to reach inside 
For the strength I need 
To hold my head up high 
 
If we push aside the blame 
For the tears and the pain 
You know love can rain 
And the world will smile again 
 
If we push aside the blame 
For the tears and the pain 
You know love can rain 
And the world will smile again 
The world will smile again 
 
All we have to do now 
Is love one another 
Sisters and brothers 
Can all live as one 
And all we have to do now 
Is show one another 
We all need each other 
To live as one in love..live as one in love 
 
All we have to do now 
Is love one another 
Sisters and brothers 
Can all live as one 
And all we have to do now 
Is show one another 
We all need each other 
To live as one in love..live as one in love
"
a1,Caught In The Middle,"

You said that love was just a state of mind 
A puzzle made of pieces you can't find 
And for me you never really had the time, and 
I was blind 
 
And everything that you meant to me 
Is written in the pages of my history 
But it's over now as far as I can see 
Suddenly 
 
Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy, I was wrong 
(And now I'm caught) 
And now, I'm caught in the middle 
Even though I'm with someone new 
All I can think about is you 
(And now I'm caught) 
And now, I'm caught in the middle 
 
Moving on, she brings me brighter days 
Thoughts of you are in my mind always 
Like a memory that I can't erase 
It's here to stay 
 
Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy, I was wrong 
(And now I'm caught) 
And now, I'm caught in the middle 
Even though I'm with someone new 
All I can think about is you 
(And now I'm caught) 
And now, I'm caught in the middle 
 
So different (It's so different) 
So easy (So easy) 
But I can't get over you (I can't get over you) 
So different (It's so different) 
So easy (So easy) 
But I can't get over you (And I can't get over you) 
 
Things are so different now you're gone 
I thought it'd be easy, I was wrong 
(And now I'm caught) 
And now, I'm caught in the middle 
Even though I'm with someone new

a1,Make It Good,"

When you're weary 
When you're down and out 
Lay your hands on me 
 
When you're weary 
When you're down and out 
Lay your hands on me 
 
I count my blessings 
I think of all i have 
She never thought about it 
Then threw it all away 
 
Left it all a chance 
She tore down fences 
Now it seems so wasted 
Wish she could turn back time 
 
Now she's down on her knees to pray 
Begging please make it good 
Make it good somehow 
She will do what it takes to change 
Someone please make it good 
Make it good somehow 
Someone please 
 
When you're weary 
When you're down and out 
Lay your hands on me 
 
She had a vision 
Time to make a stand 
For all she used to be 
To turn her life around 
 
To take back yesterday 
Is never easy 
When you're on your own 
It seems impossible, so 
 
Now she's down on her knees to pray 
Begging please make it good 
Make it good somehow 
She will do what it takes to change 
Someone please make it good 
Make it good somehow 
Someone please 
 
Welcome to your revolution 
What you dream is what you see 
There's no rules no regulations 
Let the music set you free 
 
Now she's down on her knees to pray 
Begging please make it good 
Make it good somehow 
She will do what it takes to change 
Someone please make it good

a1,Here Comes The Rain,"

There's a chill in the air 
Looks like the winter is returning 
You know I have to stay 
Until I find a way to get through this 
 
Nothing ventured nothing gained 
Now there's no healing without some kind of pain 
 
Hey baby, things have got to change 
 
Here comes the rain 
No need to hide 
I know the sunshine's on the other side 
Won't let the storm roll over me 
Tear down these walls once and for all and set me free 
Here comes the rain 
 
I left it all to chance 
Maybe the odds were all against me 
Now it's out of my hands but I will see it through if you let me 
 
Nothing ventured nothing gained 
And there's no healing without some kind of pain 
 
And you tell me baby, we can't go on this way 
 
Here comes the rain 
No need to hide 
I know the sunshine's on the other side 
Won't let the storm roll over me 
Tear down these walls once and for all and set me free 
Here comes the rain 
 
When the truth behind the lies 
All the dreams we left to die 
Were just rivers running dry 
 
Here comes the rain 
No need to hide 
I know the sunshine's on the other side 
Won't let the storm roll over me 
Tear down these walls once and for all and set me free 
 
Here comes the rain 
No need to hide 
I know the sunshine's on the other side 
Won't let the storm roll over me 
Tear down these walls once and for all and set me free 
Here comes the rain

a1,When I'm Missing You,"

Sunday morning,time to say goodbye 
But I'll be home real soon 
Though I'm leaving 
Girl don't start to cry 
I'll be thinking of you, yeah.. 
 
It's a lonely ride on a midnight train 
I'm counting down the days 'til I'm home again 
 
How can I sing when my words have run dry 
How can I smile with a tear in my eye 
Summer's so lost with raining in June 
That's how it feels when I'm missing you 
Oh, yeah, hey, baby, ooh ooh 
 
Now time ain't healing 
Another week gone by 
Girl, it feels like a year 
Hmm... 
I've been calling, every day and night 
How I wish you were here 
Oh yeah 
 
It's a lonely ride on the midnight train 
I'm counting down the days 'til I'm home again 
 
How can I sing when my words have run dry 
How can I smile with a tear in my eye 
Summer's so lost with raining in June 
That's how it feels when I'm missing you 
 
I've never met a girl who was so damn sweet 
Can't wait to see you again ooh 
I never had a love that was so complete 
And you know that I'll be dreaming 'til then 
Oh, my baby... 
 
I said tell me now, baby 
How can I sing when my words have run dry 
How can I smile with a tear in my eye 
Summer's so lost with raining in June 
That's how it feels when I'm missing you 
 
Oh yeah, baby... 
How can I smile? 
Say yeah... when I'm missing you 
Summer's so lost with raining in June 
That's how it feels when I'm missing you...

a1,This Ain't What Love Is About,"

Wherever we go, same old story 
Say you can't take no more and you wanna go home 
I give up, I don't know, just how to keep going 
When I see tears roll down your face... oh, no 
 
Oh you got me going 'round and 'round 
Yeah you got my life and turned it upside down 
 
You make it going 'round and 'round in circles 
Going down down down 
We keep talking 'bout the same old things 
We keep covering the same old ground 
Yeah we keep going around and I got to get out 
This ain't what love is about 
 
The clocks keep on turning 
The days come and go 
I think of you and know I can't let your memory go, oh 
 
Oh you got me, help me off the ground 
Yeah you got my life and turned it upside down 
 
You make it going 'round and 'round in circles 
Going down down down 
We keep talking 'bout the same old things 
We keep covering the same old ground 
Yeah we keep going around and I got to get out 
This ain't what love is about 
 
There's one way to cross this river 
But I don't know if I can deliver 
I feel broke I'm down on my knees 
We can't go on like this 
 
Yeah we keep going around and 'round in circles 
Going down down down 
We keep on talking 'bout the same old things 
We keep covering the same old ground 
 
This ain't what love is all about

a1,Crazy For Leaving You,"

The crazy things I heard you say 
I'm mad about you all the same 
I never really saw the crime 
Yet went ahead and served my time 
I never met someone like you before 
But sometimes that is not enough 
'Cause I can't help just feeling 
 
I must be crazy for leaving you 
Must be crazy for feeling blue 
But my heart lately has been untrue 
I must be crazy, crazy for leaving you 
 
I will regret this chosen mind 
I never wanna see you cry 
I care about you endlessly 
You deserve a deeper love than me 
I don't know if I'll make it on my own 
But I tried so hard to let it go 
And I can't hide this feeling 
 
I must be crazy for leaving you 
Must be crazy for feeling blue 
But my heart lately has been untrue 
I must be crazy, crazy, crazy for leaving you 
 
And I know that I will miss you like a fool 
But there's something in my life 
And I can't hide this feeling 
 
I must be crazy for leaving you 
Must be crazy for feeling blue 
But my heart lately has been untrue 
I must be crazy, crazy, crazy for leaving you
"
a1,Learn To Fly,"

When you feel the dream is over 
Feel the world is on your shoulders 
And you lost the strength to carry on 
Even though the walls may crumble 
And you find you always stumble through 
Remember never to surrender to the dark 
'Cause if you turn another page 
You will see that's not the way 
The story has to end 
 
And if you need to find a way back 
Feel you're on the wrong track 
Give it time, you'll learn to fly 
Tomorrow is a new day 
And you will find your own way 
You'll be stronger with each tear that you cry 
Then you'll learn to fly 
 
In your head, so many questions 
The truth is your possession 
The answer lies within your heart (within your heart) 
You will see the doors are open 
If you only dare to hope and you 
Will find a way to fight 
The fears that kept you down 
'Cause if you turn another page 
You will see that's not the way 
The story has to end 
 
And if you need to find a way back 
Feel you're on the wrong track 
Give it time, you'll learn to fly 
Tomorrow is a new day 
And you will find your own way 
You'll be stronger with each tear that you cry 
Then you'll learn to fly 
 
Looking at your situation 
There's so much that you can do 
Now's the time to make your stand 
This is just an observation 
In the end it's up to you 
The future's in your hands 
 
And if you need to find a way back 
Feel you're on the wrong track 
Give it time, you'll learn to fly 
Tomorrow is a new day 
And you will find your own way 
You'll be stronger with each tear that you cry 
Then you'll learn to fly 
 
Give it time 
Then you'll learn to fly
"
a1,Isn't It Cheap,"

This punky club was spinning 
Fores off a funky tee 
I'm on the floor and she was watching me 
Guess she was fine with a head to thigh inspection, yeah 
With my back against the wall I played it casually 
Man, I don't know but when she smiled at me 
And started grinding her arse 
On the hole of some dirty trumpet 
I had to say something 
 
Camera shy, no style, getting it right 
I said I wanna take you home, tonight 
And she said 
 
Let me take you to a place I know 
Right beside the dirty little picture show 
Love me if you like 
But I'm not what you need 
Nothing comes for free 
Isn't it cheap? 
 
As soon as she got me alone 
There was no her hesitation 
And started taking off all her clothes 
To Lady Paris singing 
And now I was jacking her up all night 
With a lethal injection 
The way she almost put up a fight 
Was so close to perfection 
 
Tried eyes, no ties, turn on the light 
I want to see what gets you hot, tonight 
And she said 
 
Let me take you to a place I know 
Right beside the dirty little picture show 
Love me if you like 
But I'm not what you need 
And nothing comes for free 
Isn't it cheap? 
 
C'mon, uh! 
I said, ""C'mon!"" 
Oh, baby 
Isn't it cheap? 
 
Isn't it cheap, when I'm down on my knees 
Talking sweet just to meet your demands 
See you delight as you stealing my night 
Just to play it straight into my hands 
 
Let me take you 
Let me take you baby 
Let me take you baby 
C'mon and take me baby 
 
Let me take you to a place I know 
Right beside the dirty little picture show 
Love me if you like 
But I'm not what you need 
And nothing comes for free 
Isn't it cheap? 
 
Let me take you to a place I know 
Right beside the dirty little picture show 
Love me if you like 
But I'm not what you need 
And nothing comes for free

a1,If I Can't Have You,"

Another picture on the wall 
Another life I used to live 
Another me that was untrue 
With every memory of you 
Broken in my sleep 
 
Another moment lost in time 
You talked of love and I agreed 
So many chances passed us by 
And now we've lost the strength to try 
Your love was never mine to keep 
 
We can't hold on we're losing track 
So where's the road to take us back 
And how did we forget what we believed 
 
If I can't have you 
And if the love has gone 
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on 
And if you had to leave 
Then take my life forever 
'Cause I would never be with anybody else 
If I can't have you 
 
With every night I lie awake 
With every day we grow apart 
Is there a promise we can't break 
We never learn from our mistakes 
From the very start 
 
We can't hold on we're losing track 
So where's the road to take us back 
And how did we forget what we believed 
 
If I can't have you 
And if the love has gone 
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on 
And if you had to leave 
Then take my life forever 
'Cause I would never be with anybody else 
If I can't have you 
 
Don't look back on yesterday 
'Cause the time has been and gone 
Think of what tomorrow holds 
Without you it feels so wrong 
And I can't carry on 
 
If I can't have you 
And if the love has gone 
And if you just can't find it in yourself to carry on 
And if you had to leave 
Then take my life forever 
'Cause I would never be with anybody else 
If I can't have you 
 
Oh no 
 
If I can't have you

a1,Make It Through The Night,"

She's all alone 
Making her way to a cold, empty home  
Nobody waiting and no one to hold 
She's holding her own  
He wakes up late 
Stares at the mirror to find his own face  
Picks out the pieces he hides from within  
He doesn't fit in, do you? 
 
I've made up my mind  
Everything's fine  
We're gonna make it through the night  
I've made up my mind  
Everything's fine  
We're gonna make it through the night  
 
Opens her eyes 
Looks around her  
There's faith in disguise  
There's no more secrets to shadow with lies  
She swallows her pride  
Somebody care, hard to be seen when there's nobody there  
It's getting closer, no need to pretend  
Just let it in and believe  
 
I've made up my mind  
Everything's fine  
We're gonna make it through the night  
I've made up my mind  
Everything's fine  
We're gonna make it through the night  
 
Maybe today or maybe tomorrow  
Guess the hands of fate 
Been making you wait too long  
I know the way to forget all your sorrow  
Be the first in line to admit that you were wrong  
Sometimes  
 
I've made up my mind  
Everything's fine  
We're gonna make it through the night  
I've made up my mind  
Everything's fine  
We're gonna make it through the night  
 
Gonna make it through the night now baby  
Gonna make it through the night now baby  
Gonna make it through the night now baby  
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
 
I've made up my mind  
Everything's fine  
We're gonna make it through the night  
I've made up my mind  
Everything's fine  
We're gonna make it through the night

a1,Cherish This Love,"

Sorry for making you cry 
For turning away 
As you walk on by 
But baby I need to be strong 
And I need to move on with my life 
You know it's not that I don't care 
So don't make me feel bad 
It's not fair 
Baby you know all the reasons 
I made my decisions in life 
Now a girl's gotta do 
What a girl's gotta do 
And a boy has to become a man 
And I'm sorry for saying 
But it's love that I need 
And that love I just can't get from you 
 
It's funny how things turned around 
One day I am lost 
Then I'm found 
It happened so fast 
I knew it would last 
From the first time 
I first looked in your eyes 
Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears 
She buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more 
 
You know it's not easy to do 
Turning my back on me and you 
But baby I need someone there 
Who will love me and care for my life 
Smiles they turned into tears 
And all of my dreams 
They all disappeared 
Baby this cannot be right 
So I'll turn down the light 
On our love 
Now a boy's gotta do 
What a boy's gotta do 
And a girl has to do what she can 
And I'm sorry for saying 
But it's love that I need 
And that love I just can't get from you 
 
It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost 
Then I'm found 
It happened so fast 
I knew it would last

Although it's so soon this I know 
I'll never be on my own 
Dreams turn to tears 
She buries my fears 
And I will cherish this love ever more 
 
And everything that could gone wrong 
Has gone wrong at some time 
Now I can see the light 
It was love at first sight 
And I'm not gonna let this girl go 
 
It's funny how things turn around 
One day I am lost 
Then I'm found 
It happened so fast

a1,Do You Remember?,"

Looking back on yesterday 
Memories won't fade away 
I can't forget the love we made 
So beautiful, we had it all 
No use looking to the past 
We both knew it wouldn't last 
 
But it was fun we had a blast 
So beautiful, as I recall 
Where did it go yeah, yeah, yeah 
 
Say do you remember on the first of December 
When we were riding on the backseat 
Turned the radio on and played our favorite song 
And there we were making out to the back beat 
My girl'd get sad and your man'd get mad 
They don't have to know 
Do you remember singing, now? 
 
Breaking rules we always would 
Doing things we never should 
We were so bad but it felt so good 
Do you remember say do you remember 
I wonder where you are tonight 
But I know that you'll be alright 
'Cause I see our star is shining bright 
It's so beautiful, it will never fall 
Where did you go 
 
Come on now, sing it loud 
 
Say do you remember on the first of December 
When we were riding on the backseat

Just tell me how you feel 
I don't know what you're thinking anymore

Told you I'm leaving 
'Til you begged me to stay

And lady roll up your sleeves

Keeping me warm until I had to be gone 
And now you can't find no room in your head 
To say you got out of bed 
Or that my coffee ain't on 
 
The door was open 'til you locked it up 
And then you threw out the key 
Why can't you tell me that we're breaking up

A puzzle made of pieces you can't find 
And for me you never really had the time

Is written in the pages of my history

De vouloir s'aimer plus que tout

Moving on she brings me brighter days 
Thoughts of you are in my mind always 
Like a memory that I can't erase 
It's here to stay, woo-ooh

(So different) Nos diffÃ©rences 
(So easy) So easy 
(But I can't get over you) Plus rien ne t'efface

a1,It Happens Every Day,"

What have I become 
I wish that I could go some place 
Where nobody knows you now 
Nobody knows you now 
Nobody knows you 
 
This heart it weighs a ton 
Some memories you can't escape 
And nobody shows you how 
Nobody shows you how 
 
Yet I still wait for you 
Living in this state for you 
'Cause I believe a heart can change 
It happens every day 
I'll wear these scars for you 
I'll reignite the spark for you 
'Cause I believe a heart can change 
It happens every day 
It happens every day 
 
I don't want friends around 
Still I don't wanna be alone, no no 
Somebody hold me now 
Somebody hold me now 
 
'Cause I still wait for you 
Living in this state for you 
'Cause I believe a heart can change 
It happens every day 
I'll wear these scars for you 
I'll reignite the spark for you 
'Cause I believe a heart can change 
It happens every day 
It happens every day 
 
Sometimes 
A sinner becomes a saint 
Sometimes 
Believers can lose their faith  
Sometimes 
We learn from our mistakes 
 
So I still wait for you 
Living in this state for you 
'Cause I believe a heart can change 
It happens every day 
I'll wear these scars for you 
I'll reignite the spark for you 
'Cause I believe a heart can change 
It happens every day 
It happens every day 
 
It happens every day

a1,Don't Wanna Lose You Again,"

I can feel that the wheels in motion 
In this life in this song time and again 
Looking back there's a new reflection 
Now I know what you give is what you get 
 
In the end it's all-or-nothing 
And I feel I'm ready now 
So I try to be the answer 
'Cause I don't wanna lose you again 
 
Now I bet that your ears are burning 
With three words on the tip of my tongue 
I just hope that your heart is open 
So that I can undo what I've done 
 
In the end it's all-or-nothing 
And I feel I'm ready now 
So I try to be the answer 
'Cause I don't wanna lose you again 
 
Like a star it's so hard to reach you 
Not enough just to call you a friend 
And I know that I don't deserve you 
But I don't wanna lose you again oh 
 
In the end it's all-or-nothing 
And I feel I'm ready now 
So I try to be the answer 
'Cause I don't wanna lose you again 
No, I don't wanna lose you again

a1,Bad Enough,"

Baby come back, hear me out 
Is there any way to reach you now 
Sitting on the edge, thinking out loud 
Maybe there is something that you know 
Something that only you know 
 
Crying out loud, I wanna do good 
I'd do it all for you if I could 
The way it looks now from where I stood 
Maybe there is something that you know 
Something that only you know 
 
But running away isn't the way 
'Cause if you want it bad enough 
Get it if you don't give up 
Running away isn't the way

If you want it bad enough 
 
If you want it bad 
If you want it bad 
If you want it bad enough 
If you want it bad 
If you want it bad 
If you want it bad enough 
 
Take a little time think this through 
See it from another point of view 
Putting myself in any old shoes 
Maybe there is somewhere that you go 
Somewhere that only you go 
 
Trying to move on all the way down 
Waiting for your head to hit the ground 
Whatever you're in we'll figure it out 
Maybe there is something I do now 
That wherever you go 
 
But running away isn't the way 
'Cause if you want it bad enough 
Get it if you don't give up 
Running away isn't the way 
'Cause if you want it bad enough 
Get it if you don't give up

a1,Nothing In Common,"

Photographs in a cardboard box 
Remind me I can't turn back the clocks 
So far now from the starting blocks 
I still don't know what this key unlocks 
 
I say who 
Made you give it away 
Say who, oh, no 
There's nothing left to say 
 
You and me, seems we got 
Nothing in common now 
Nothing in common now 
There's nothing to talk about 
Like two ships sailing into 
Different directions now 
Isn't it funny how 
We've nothing in common now 
 
Spiraling down 
Memory lane I went 
Hitting it hard 
To hammer out the dents 
No more sitting on a broken fence 
It's to rebuild my confidence 
 
I say who 
Made you give it away 
I said who, oh, no 
There's nothing left to say, heh 
 
You and me, seems we got 
Nothing in common now 
Nothing in common now 
There's nothing to talk about 
Like two ships sailing into 
Different directions now 
Isn't it funny how 
We've nothing in common now 
 
We dance, we fall, we lose it all 
And we dance, we fall, we lose it all 
 
Nice to see that you're doing well 
You're happy now as far as I can tell 
We soldier on with the hands we're dealt 
We're strangers now to the way we felt 
 
You and me, seems we got 
Nothing in common now 
Nothing in common now 
There's nothing to talk about 
Like two ships sailing into 
Different directions now 
Isn't it funny how 
We've nothing in common now

I'm gonna take this chance to be up all night 
I wanna fix this up just the way you like 
I wanna shake the weight of the world, that's right 
I gotta make the most of this old street light 
 
And if you think I'm talking too much just tell me 
If you need to change the pace then help me 
We've got ten more minutes to go 
I said, we've got ten more minutes before we go 
 
There's no regrets 
At least not yet 
And it's safe to go 
I heard it on the radio 
So I'll take you home 
 
You know I need somebody to love me yes 
You know that I won't settle for second best 
We gotta live like that ignore the rest 
So if they all go east, then we'll go west 
You know I dance my life to a different beat 
And I like it here on the edge of my seat 
And now the stage is set, and we're alone 
Where we'll end up later, we don't know 
 
There's no regrets 
At least not yet 
And it's safe to go 
I heard it on the radio 
So I'll take you home 
 
I take you home 
Well, I take you home 
 
And if it gets too crowded then may I suggest 
That when they all go east then we'll go west 
C'mon let's go, go, go 
And where we'll end up, we don't know! 
 
There's no regrets 
At least not yet

I know a girl with a broken smile 
He's been hurting her for quite a while 
But she loves him 
She still loves him 
I've got a friend with a heart of gold 
He loved his wife even when he was told 
She's unfaithful 
He's still faithful 
 
I guess in life you don't always reap what you sow 
It doesn't make much sense but i'd like to know 
 
Why do good things happen to bad people 
Bad people 
Don't deserve it 
Why do bad things happen to good people 
Good people 
Don't deserve it 
 
I've seen a man working all his life 
Lose his job to a new device 
Still he's grateful 
Yeah, he's grateful 
I know somebody who's got all they need 
Who built an empire stepping on the weak 
Still ungrateful 
So ungrateful 
 
I guess in life you don't always reap what you sow 
It doesn't make much sense but I'd like to know 
 
Why do good things happen to bad people 
Bad people 
Don't deserve it 
Why do bad things happen to good people

Don't deserve it 
 
Who decides this? 
It seems so unfair 
Is there somebody out there? 
Who decides this? 
Does anyone care 
Is there somebody 
Somebody out there?

Bad people 
Don't deserve it 
Why do bad things happen to good people

Some of us were born to break 
The slightest knock is all it takes 
I'm sleeping while I'm wide awake, whoa 
 
I've tried to thicken up my skin 
I'm having trouble fitting in 
I'd rather sink than never swim, whoa 
 
Now all my life I have learned 
It's me just me against the world 
 
Now the world's moving faster 
This could be a disaster 
Is the change that I'm making 
Worth the risk that I'm taking 
Now the world's moving faster 
This could be ever after 
Is chaos creating  
The perfect disaster 
 
Every time I talk I choke 
I hide behind the songs I wrote 
It's killing me with every note, whoa 
 
Will all my fears be confirmed  
Is it me just me against the world 
 
Now the world's moving faster 
This could be a disaster 
Is the change that I'm making 
Worth the risk that I'm taking 
Now the world's moving faster 
This could be ever after 
Is chaos creating  
The perfect disaster 
 
As far as I am concerned 
It's now you and me against the world

a1,The Life That Could Have Been,"

I met someone the other day 
It's good to see her face again 
She's the one who got away 
Way back when 
 
Showed photos of her family 
Soon to marry mum to be 
She used to want all that with me 
And she smiled and I laughed 
 
Then I imagined if I didn't take that flight 
What would my world be like? 
Would I be standing at the altar by her side? 
Would her child be mine? 
And I think that I've just seen 
The life that could have been 
 
She's happy now and that's a fact 
And who am I to mess with that 
So I won't try to get her back 
In a way I'm glad 
 
'Cause that was then and this is now 
Still I can't help but think about 
All the things that I'm without 
But I wave the white flag 
 
Then I imagined if I didn't take that flight 
What would my world be like? 
Would I be standing at the altar by her side? 
Would her child be mine? 
And I think that I've just seen 
The life that could have been 
 
And as she was walking away 
I thought I saw her 
Turn back and hesitate 
Look at me as if to say 
 
I imagined if you didn't take that flight 
What would my world be like? 
Would you be standing at the altar by my side? 
What would our child look like? 
 
Then I imagined if I didn't take that flight 
What would my world be like? 
Would I be standing at the altar by her side? 
Would her child be mine? 
And it's the strangest thing 
And I think that I've just seen 
The life that could have been 
 
The life that should have been

But how could they know? 
How can I make it on my own?

a1,Fallen From Grace,"

Is anybody there? 
I come up for air 
Feels like I'm drowning 
Does anybody care? 
It makes no sense at all 
Such a long way to fall 
I knew it was coming 
I could feel it in the air 
 
Feels like I'm falling 
It's time but your stalling 
You said all you need is a little time and some space 
These words that you've spoken 
Have left me so broken 
Seems at this moment that 
I've fallen from grace 
 
Is anyone around? 
My head hits the ground 
I feel like I'm no one 
I'm lost in the crowd 
It makes no sense at all 
So divided we fall 
I'm breaking my silence 
But you don't hear me call 
And you don't see me fall 
 
Feels like I'm falling 
It's time but your stalling 
You said all you need is a little time and some space 
These words that you've spoken 
Have left me so broken 
Seems at this moment that 
I've fallen from grace 
 
And everyday just feels the same 
I try so hard to walk away from everything I am 
Just closing in on me 
I just can't face the pain 
I sit around and wonder why? 
So many dreams can fade and die 
Well nothing is forever everything is never 
And I can't say goodbye 
 
Feels like I'm falling 
It's time but your stalling 
You said all you need is a little time and some space 
These words that you've spoken 
Have left me so broken 
Seems at this moment that 
I've fallen from grace

Starlight 
Even though I'm not with you tonight 
Just let them light up your room 
You know that they're shining for you 
We're looking out on the same sky starlight 
 
Everybody gets down sometime 
When I get down I turn to rhyme 
I write lyrics like diary 
When the words come out yeah it's good for me 
But every body needs a little help 
When you lost for words and you can't help yourself 
Just step out to your balcony and 
 
Just look up to the starlight

Why (do) you lost your confidence 
You're beautiful, it don't make sense to me 
It's been a while since I've seen you laugh 
Last time you face it for a photograph 
And when there's no one to hold ya 
And you're all out of hope 
Just remember what I told ya 
Just step out to your balcony and 
 
Just look up to the starlight

a1,Blackout,"

Your eyes. They tell me something 
I heard a rumor saying you're alone again 
On your own again 
 
That really got me thinking 
I know that you're looking for love but maybe 
Until then you just need a friend 
 
We don't have to tell nobody 
Our secret's safe don't worry 
No string no complication 
It's just a ""win-win"" situation 
 
Don't stop don't resist 
'Cause you and I can coexist 
When the lights go out 
Reach out take a risk 
And be my friend with benefits 
When the lights go out 
 
Go separate ways when leaving 
Both know when later you'll be home with me 
Be alone with me yeah 
No heart that we're deceiving 
No harm in what we're feeling 
As long as we don't think of what could be 
 
We don't have to tell nobody 
Our secret's safe don't worry 
No string no complication 
It's just a ""win-win"" situation 
 
Don't stop don't resist 
'Cause you and I can coexist

a1,Just 3 Words,"

No more drama 
I'm going under 
With your face so full of thunder 
Lay it on me evidently 
There's an elephant in the room 
 
Can't think straight I can't go on 
It's hit me hard but I can't give up 
Speak to me 'cause it's killing me 
 
You can change my world 
Just say the line 
With just three words 
You'd save my life 
 
When it comes down 
To the wire 
One spark can start a fire 
So come on now 
Let it all out 
Before my heart goes tick tick boom 
 
Can't think straight I can't go on 
It's hit me hard but I can't give up 
Speak to me 'cause it's killing me 
 
Think about how eleven letters 
Mean the world when they're put together 
They can change our lives forever 
Say them now 'cause it's now-or-never 
 
You can change my world 
Just say the line 
With just three words 
You'd save my life 
 
You can change my world 
Just say the line

a1,Stones,"

I used to be stardust 
Then came the big bang 
Then I turned to mountain the bed rock the sand 
Chiseled and broken 
Shaped by a man 
Turned into weapon in his hands 
 
Too many stones  
Too many stones  
Too many stones have been thrown 
 
A piece of a bridge 
A break in a wall 
I can be anything at all 
A tip of an arrow 
The very first wheel 
I held the command and always will 
 
Too many stones  
Too many stones  
Too many stones have been thrown 
 
So lay me down, build a path 
Walk on me together 
Let me be your common ground 
And hold on to each other 
Lay me down 
Lay me down oh 
Too many stones have been thrown 
 
Too many stones  
Too many stones  
Too many stones have been thrown 
 
Oh lay me down 
 
Too many stones (Lay me down) 
Too many stones (just lay me down) 
Too many stones have been thrown

a1,Grateful,"

When I'm grateful 
And I'm starring at the sky 
I feel so small 
Like a ship against the tide 
Still I know, there's a simple truth 
 
I am grateful 
When I hear the saddest song 
In that moment 
I know I am not alone 
Someone else, feels the same way too 
 
To be grateful 
Even in my heartache and my pain 
To be grateful 
When it feels like I'm about to break 
 
Ever grateful 
For the scars along the way 
And I'm thankful 
For each mistake I've made 
'Cause somehow, it all led me to you 
 
To be grateful 
Even in my heartache and my pain 
To be grateful 
When it feels like I'm about to break 
 
When I'm grateful 
And I'm starring at the sky 
I feel so small 
Still so good to be alive 
'Cause I know, I shared it all with you

a1,2:59,"

Sunday football I got booed off the pitch 
Some people gamble as a way to get rich 
I got to find a better way to invest in zeroes oh 
Cigarettes may damage your wealth 
I'd rather save it all to spend on myself 
I got a letter of eviction and I'm no hero 
 
I'm not a saver I'm a spender 
I'm a one weekender 
 
What can we do when our two worlds collide? 
There's only ten ways to survive all the chances of knowing 
After a hard day at work I go home 
I don't know where I'm going but I'm ready to go 
I made a lot of money but got nothing to show 
And now it's 2:59 
And I'm still waiting for the train to go home 
 
I've been thinking 'bout the meaning of life 
Plenty of butter but I don't have a knife 
Sure beats the hell out of waiting for a ticket to Rino 
Watching TV makes me really upset 
I wonder why I haven't been on it yet 
I'm still waiting for a part in a Tarantino 
 
I'm not a saver I'm a spender 
I'm a one weekender 
 
What can we do when our two worlds collide? 
There's only ten ways to survive all the chances of knowing 
After a hard day at work I go home 
You know I don't know where I'm going but I'm ready to go 
I made a lot of money but got nothing to show 
And now it's 2:59 
And I'm still waiting for the train to go home 
Yeah yeah I said I wanna go home 
 
What can we do when our two worlds collide? 
Ah 
After a hard day at work I go home 
I don't know where I'm going but I'm ready to go 
I said I made a lot of money but got nothing to show 
And now it's 2:59

a1,After All It's Christmas,"

I feel the joy in this Christmas time 
But something's missing in this heart of mine 
The choirs sings that the season's here 
I always miss you this time of year 
 
It's crowded out in Trafalgar square  
But it feels so empty when you're not there 
They're all waiting for snow to fall  
But I'm still waiting for a miracle 
 
I left my heart underneath the tree 
I believe after all it's Christmas 
Pray the lights lead you back to me 
I believe after all it's Christmas 
Oh... 
I believe after all it's Christmas 
Oh... 
I believe after all it's Christmas time 
 
If New Year comes and my gifts still there 
The lights come down and the tree is bare 
I'll keep it wrapped 'til December then 
I'll place it under the tree again 
 
I left my heart underneath the tree 
I believe after all it's Christmas 
Pray the lights lead you back to me 
I believe after all it's Christmas 
Oh... 
I believe after all it's Christmas 
Oh... 
I believe after all it's Christmas time 
 
Christmas morning finally  
I run downstairs excitedly 
Then to my surprise I see 
The greatest gift in front of me 
 
You left your heart underneath the tree 
I believe after all it's Christmas 
I guess the lights led you back to me 
I believe after all it's Christmas 
Oh... 
I believe after all it's Christmas 
Oh... 
I believe after all it's Christmas  
 
You left my heart underneath the tree 
I believe after all it's Christmas 
I guess the lights led you back to me 
I believe after all it's Christmas 
Oh... 
I believe after all it's Christmas 
Oh... 
I believe after all it's Christmas time

a1,Another Year Gone,"

I watched the ice melt away 
I saw the cold wind change 
But like in an old snow globe 
In my world, it's always winter 
 
As flakes settle to the ground  
You turn me upside down  
And back to start I go 
In my world, it's always winter 
 
Another year gone 
I've been here too long 
All of my new years 
Resolution have gone wrong 
I'm still on this shelf 
Waiving farewell 
To another year gone 
 
Here on your window sill 
It's as if time stood still 
I'm stuck in this wonderland  
But it's all fake 
It's only glitter  
 
Another year gone 
I've been here too long 
All of my new years 
Resolution have gone wrong 
I'm still on this shelf 
Waiving farewell 
To another year gone 
 
Be careful how hard you shake 
'Cause one day this glass will break 
Water will flow like tears 
And I'll sail away on that river 
 
Another year gone 
I've been here too long 
All of my New Year's 
Resolutions have gone wrong 
I'm still on this shelf 
All by myself 
Another year gone

That's the way where I come from 
Build a heart that's made to last 
Shape the future with the past 
 
Hold a lantern, light the way

Face our demons side by side

A cavalry at your command 
Lead the charge, I'll be your shield 
Standin' on the battlefield 
Nothing can harm you, I'll be the armour 
For your heart 
 
We will leave no stone unturned 
Walk away from bridges burned 
With the world here at our feet 
We're an army, you and me

Lead the charge, I'll be your shield

What if then somehow something's changed 
What if I never got to say 
All of the words I meant to 
What if I never saw the signs 
What if your life was all but fine 
What if I missed you all the time 
And never got to tell you 
 
Oooo can you call me when you land 
So that I feel better 
Oooo while you're busy making plans 
Remember to write that letter 
To your grandma 
Tell someone you love them 
Go see Mom and Dad 
Just be sure 
To hug them while you can 
 
What if my words don't reach you right 
What if you're never within sight 
What if you lie alone at night 
Without a prayer to cling to 
What I you never knew the truth 
What if your heart was broke in two 
What if I somehow could save you 
But never got the chance to tell you 
 
Oooo can you call me when you land 
So that I feel better 
Oooo while you're busy making plans 
Remember to write that letter 
To your grandma 
Tell someone you love them 
Go see Mom and Dad 
Just be sure 
To hug them while you can

When I feel the hands ticking away 
And I'm falling behind 
I can hear you say

Remember to write that letter 
Oooo can you call me when you land

a1,Come On Down,"

I can't help but I wanna be around you 
Can't forget about my home 
When I'm lonely 
You might not know but I always think about you 
As you fall upon your soul 
I wanna thank you 
 
Home is where I belong 
It's a place, I'm taken from 
Hold a prayer, save a song 
Shine a light and keep it on 
 
Come on down 
There's a fire in my heart 
Stay around 
'Cause I need you here right now 
Come on down 
And take me back to solid ground 
Come on down 
 
You're always around when I have some time to steal 
When I need some time to heal 
For remedy (for remedy) 
And there are times when it's hard to be myself 
Turn me into someone else 
But you know me 
 
Home is where I belong 
But it's a place, I'm taken from 
Hold a prayer, save a song 
Shine a light and keep it on 
And on and on 
 
Come on down 
There's a fire in my heart 
Stay around 
'Cause I need you here right now 
Come on down 
And take me back to solid ground 
Stay around 
Come on down 
Come on down 
 
Call on to please me tonight in a while 
Just so I'm kind when I'm home 
Days turn to seasons and years have gone by 
Hold on 
 
Come on down 
There's a fire in my heart 
Stay around 
'Cause I need you here right now 
Come on down 
And take me back to solid ground 
Come on down 
 
I said come on down 
'Cause there's a fire in my heart 
I said and you'll look down 
Just I need you here right now 
You gotta come on down 
And bring me back to solid ground 
Come on down

We could stay up all night by the moonlight 
Watch the sunrise with the butterflies 
We can fight all night, we can yell and cry 
We never say goodbye, we're always side-by-side 
 
I will go where you go 
Side-by-side we are two forever 
Together we will grow 
This is our fight, it's now-or-never

Some days we surf 'em

a1,Do I Need A Reason,"

Today when I saw you 
I knew it was just like the first time 
When you met my eyes I came close 
And I felt like the first time 
 
To hold back my fear 
And feel you so near 
I've never been this far before 
To hold back my fear 
And feel you so near 
I'm scared of falling into deep this time 
 
Do I need a reason to tell you why 
I'm singing you this song 
Do I need a reason to show you that 
I know where I belong 
Whenever I am weary I lean on 
This feeling that I have 
I am so much stronger now 
Thankful, yes I am 
 
Today I'll renounce them 
The doubts and the fears I've been nursing 
I'll fly like a moth to the flame 
And I'll feel like the first time 
 
To hold back my fear 
And let you come near 
I've never been this far before 
To hold back my fear 
And let you come near 
I'm 'fraid of losing and still I go

And threw it away 
It's safe to say 
You do it again 
 
You just can't get it right 
But I'll be here for you my friend 
Just like before 
You do it again 
 
How can you turn your back on a girl you rely on? 
Then you leave it to me to try and turn it around 
Now you're up all night, head in your hands 
How can I help you understand? 
It's the same old story time after time 
 
Take a look at your life (Take a look) 
You just found heaven 
And threw it away 
It's safe to say 
You do it again (No, you do it again) 
 
You just can't get it right (Oh no, you can't) 
But I'll be here for you my friend 
Just like before 
You do it again 
 
I can't believe you did it again 
You're only breaking your heart like this 
Just tearing you apart and then 
You're right back where you started 
Oh baby 
 
Now you're up all night, head in your hands 
How can I help you understand? 
It's the same old story time after time

a1,Power Of Desire,"

Falling for a fantasy 
I threw away my destiny 
I don't know where to stop 
Healing broken hearts 
 
I'll think about it endlessly 
My eyes too dry to cry 
For I've forced 
All this time 
All this time 
With you, ooh 
 
I was tempted by the power of desire 
I surrendered to the calling of the fire 
There's nothing I could ever say 
To change the things I did 
But I promise you 
I'll make it up to you 
 
Take me back to yesterday 
When all our dreams were swept away 
I'd never cross that line 
I'd change the course of time 
 
I could never live this way 
If only you'd forgive 
We'll start again 
With all my heart 
With all my love for you 
All my love for you 
 
No surrender no return 
If only you believe that
"
a1,Spiders,"

It's not you 
It's not my fault 
It's complicated 
We fed them lies 
We crept and crawled 
Until they ate it 
 
Fooled them one by one 
We hid we bit our tongue 
I guess we went one step too far 
 
My heart's like a drum 
Beating out of my chest 
All the lies that we spread will come bite us 
Now the damage is done 
Even if we confess 
We've been spinning a web 
Like spiders 
And the lies that we spun 
Are unravelling, yes 
Now we're caught up in a sticky situation 
We've been spinning a web like spiders 
 
Spiders, spiders, spinning a web 
Spiders, spiders, spinning a web 
Spiders, spiders, spinning a web 
We've been spinning a web like spiders 
 
We kept the truth 
Hid in plain sight 
We celebrated 
We laid in silk 
We wrapped up tight 
And suffocated 
 
Like poison through your veins 
It sucks the life out of you 
Then it leaves you paralyzed 
 
My heart's like a drum 
Beating out of my chest 
All the lies that we spread will come bite us 
Now the damage is done 
Even if we confess 
We've been spinning a web 
Like spiders 
And the lies that we spun 
Are unravelling, yes 
Now we're caught up in a sticky situation 
We've been spinning a web like spiders 
 
So beautiful and so alluring 
You can't stop yourself from falling 
You better know there's no escaping now 
No, once you're in there ain't no getting out 
So beautiful and so alluring 
You can't stop yourself from falling 
You better know there's no escaping now 
There no getting out because now 
 
My heart's like a drum 
Beating out of my chest 
All the lies that we spread will come bite us 
Now the damage is done 
Even if we confess 
We've been spinning a web

And the lies that we spun

a1,Three Times A Lady,"

Thanks for the times that you've given me 
The memories are all in my mind. 
And now that we've come to the end of our rainbow 
There's something I must say out loud 
 
Your once, twice, three times a lady 
And I love you... 
Yes your once, twice, three times a lady 
And I love you... I love you... 
 
When we are together the moments I cherish 
With every beat of my heart 
To touch you, to hold you 
To feel you, to need you 
There's nothing to keep us apart 
 
Your once, twice, three times a lady 
And I love you... I love you

With every Christmas card I write 
May your days be merry and bright 
And may all 
Your Christmases be white

I was chasing a bag, you was chasing these hoes 
Like I ain't got time to lotion 
 
My bro's in the lab like Dexter 
And she wanna take this BBC and I ain't talkin' 'bout 1Xtra 
Defend my bros like Evra 
All my haters hating 
I just tell 'em, ""Back to sender"" 
I might bell her in 
Then put her right back like HÃ©ctor 
The world's so fucked nowadays 
All they do is follow and follow (Facts) 
I don't care 'bout the latest trends 
'Cause I might even die tomorrow 
That's why I ain't sleepy like hollow 
If I ever win the lotto 
I'll share that with my family 
And make sure they don't borrow 
 
You wouldn't know this, but my heart is cold like my home is 
Where were you when we could've been homeless? 
I can't have a bitch 'cause I'd probably lose focus 
You know, get lost in the moment 
I could probably end up heartbroken 
I was chasing a bag, you was chasing these hoes 
Like I ain't got time to lotion 
 
I'm tryna get high 
I'm tryna reach the sky 
Told her, ""Babes, come, we bill it,"" 
She said, ""Why not tonight?""

A1 x J1,Latest Trends (Remix),"

I ain't got time for a ho (They know) 
And broski's like the devil 'cause he likes takin' people's souls 
This, this ain't a football drill when we say that we keep them on their toes 
My bro came out of the slammer, now I'm screamin', ""Fresh home, fresh home"" 
Now I'm screamin', ""Fresh home, fresh home"" 
Excuse me, miss, can you clap for the NHS? 
And darling, if you can't do that, KMT, the disrespect 
They talk on my name 'cause they brass and wet 
Them man are bums, tell 'em go get bread 
I ain't got time for the stupid gems 
I dick that ting, then I'm onto the ne-e-ext 
 
DTB, till a nigga get old, or these hoes made my heart weight colder 
You couldn't know this, I'm way too focused, yeah 
Can't trust no hoes, gotta take away phones, cause the opps might know them, plus 
How the niggas wanna roll on us? 
Never know, so I keep one up 
In the club, where they keep one tucked 
Armed and dangerous 
It's us, never them, I don't need new friends, no intentions on changin' up 
They shootin', sorry if I made you look so stupid 
 
Put you on the same direction 
Come through when you want to, cause you're my favorite bitch 
And I'm your favorite artist, come thru and paint it up quick 
Me and my guys been doing this fly shit before Bathing Ape shit 
Money conversations ain't done, uh

I'm an artist, Pablo 
I don't trust no one except my bros 
'Cause anyone can stab you in the backbone 
Tsss, that's the snakes in the grass 
I guess that's true, tough time never last 
Didn't like being broke so I had to graft 
They're mad 'cause they got left in the past 
Came a long way from an Insta freestyle, but that's all part of the journey 
Been doin' this shit from early 
Dio, that's my bro from nursery (Nursery, nursery) 
I don't take L's or lose 
Now I'm plugged in with Fumez 
I'm not the same as you 
They can't do what I do 
I put my pain in the track, that's the way that I cope 
Got the 20, gotta get it my bro 
I know they hate I'm gettin' the stones 
I know they hate, but there ain't nothin' to show 
So let me hold you 
Girl, don't tell nobody 
You got me goin' crazy, crazy 
Ain't answering your phone lately

And if you hated me, please, just keep your distance 
I'm chasin' figures and them man chasin' women 
That's why me and you are different (Are different) 
Yeah, they want more music 
Saying ""A & J need to be consistent"" 
Spin, spiral, wave, tidal 
A & J, that's viral 
I don't trust these girls, that's final 
Can't believe that I made here this year 
Now everybody's acts like they know me 
Now we're up top like Wilfried Bony 
I don't got time for these phonies 
 
You don't realise what you got 'til you lose it 
I tried give you my love and you abused it, useless 
Looking for love, but I ain't cupid 
'Cah me cuffing a hoe, must be deluded 
She hate when I play but my feelings will never change 
My heart is programmed too, women are really the same

She thinks that the kid is trash 
'Cause I had a brown skin ting that I beat and dashed 
Is it my fault that I learnt from my dad, hmm? 
They say they are road, they're fakers, blatant by the kway 
I'm still screaming DTB, but right now it's HBK, K 
 
She matching my drip, she matching my kicks 
And she got gorgeous hips 
And she wanna take this dick 
And bro's in the pitch doing rainbow flicks 
And back then she didn't rate the kid 
Now she wanna jump on my pogo stick 
Give her this wood then vanish, vanish

And you can't enter my heart so I send her to the streets 
She wanna vibes with the kid like Kartel 
Bro's on the pitch wanna score these goals 
That's Man United like Martial 
I don't know if she loves the kid or hates the kid 
Let me know, 'cause I can't tell 
But I ain't gonna wait for a chick 'cause I'm chasin' the quid 
And my heart, that I can't sell (Sorry, babes) 
Oh well 
When they lie, I see 
They're cappin' and I can see it through their eyes, times have changed 
Back then I was broke, we was living in pain 
Like Tory, I had to switch the lanes 
Make a name, change the game 
Haters, haters, all the same 
Gotta buy mum a crib 'fore I buy a chain 
But most of you couldn't relate 
 
She thinks that the kid is trash 
'Cause I had a brown skin ting that I beat and dashed

A,Winter Of '96,"

First stepped out of the aeroplane 
I'd felt like I'd been here before 
Took a ?? me down 
Put a smile on my face 
Felt like I could do more 
 
How ace are buildings! 
How big are the blocks 
Reminds me of London, stuck in a graveyard 
 
Six foot deep, bleaker street, no one lives out 
People smile, never got the time 
I look down I can not see the ground 
A man who reads the news says there's no crime 
There's no one around 
There wasn't a sound 
There's no one to arrest today 
?? 
 
Fell in love with it, don't want to leave it 
Don't ever what to go back 
Skateboards are cheaper, don't want it bigger 
Whole place stops for the winter of '96 
 
-10, 1pm east village time 
I laugh at your ?? you bought 
Snow, snow, so we walk 70 blocks 
On days like this nothing seems to far 
Get in shot, I don't ask a lot 
The weather was frozen, there wasn't a ?? 
 
Fell in love with it, don't want to leave it 
Don't ever what to go back 
Skateboards are cheaper, don't want it bigger 
Whole place stops for the winter of '96 
 
Maybe I could be here a long time 
Much longer than I planned to stay 
No telling when they'll get the airport open 
No telling when i'll get way 
Trying to tell us nothing's wrong 
Trying to get the fire back on 
Never lost a day of fun 
Silence in the heightened mass of ?? 
 
How ace are buildings! 
How big are the blocks 
Reminds me of London, stuck in a gridlock

You're always fighting everyone 
You were wroung when you were young 
You love to think you're on the run 
 
I had to laugh at all your jokes 
Had to tremble 'cos you smoked 
But you never ever get my vote, yeah! 
 
You're the ones to run from, or so they say 
I remember you back in the day 
Did my best to keep out of the way 
You kicked it up in school 
Singing out of tune 
 
While you're fighting everyone 
I've been hanging in the sun 
There's a million things I've done 
 
You're the one who took the lead 
Me least likely to succeed 
Different now don't you agree 
 
You're the ones to run from, or so they say 
I remember you back in the day 
Did my best to keep out of the way 
You kicked it up in school

I like the summer like you like your wife 
Live in the ""master"" for the rest of my life 
Every year since I was young 
And always here and always fun 
Distant places, staying faces 
All I want, I understand is it's the summer 
 
Over and over it's summer again 
Fills up the sad hole in my head again 
Several hours and passing faster 
To lift their head down to the sand 
Distant places, staying faces 
All I want, I understand is it's the summer 
 
And it's with it's flowers, and big huge skies 
It gets high for hours, and then it dies 
 
Ocean keeps me up all night 
Sunshine makes my hair turn white 
You know I hate the winter time 
All because there's nothing quite like the summer 
 
And it's with it's flowers, and breeses off shore 
It gets high for hours, and then back for more 
 
And it's with it's showers, and big big skies 
It gets high for hours, and then it dies

It's summer on the underground 
So much sweat a man could drown 
There's a panic on the overland 
And London Bridge is falling down 
 
The temperature is 92 
It's baking in the vocal booth 
All the tourists come in June 
There's so many you can't move 
There's people getting rich today 
There's people that they've got to pay 
There's lots of places I could go 
We should be rocking in the studio 
 
Don't feel like working today, I feel like getting away 
Don't feel like driving today, I feel like getting away 
 
Dalston is a wicked place 
At weekends it gets off its face 
And everybody calls you mate 
But do they really want to know? 
The drinks machine is running out 
And please don't use that ticket touts 
The ladies have it all on show 
We should be rocking in the studio 
 
Don't feel like working today, I feel like getting away 
Don't feel like driving today, I feel like getting away 
 
On my feet for a week thinking nobody cares 
And I can't get to sleep thinking nobody shares 
Are you taking to me? Get out of the way 
We walk on the left and good manners are free 
You don't have to pay 
You know you just can't see, everything in a day,

Got no back up plan in case we blow it

Too much work to do, rocking new improved, keep it in the family 
It's not over, 'till it's over anyway

Four long years ago, searching for the snow 
We found the Tahoe lakes, just about the perfect place 
50 Runs at 'Heavenly', and the nights at 'Squaw Valley' 
Yeah, the trees are pretty wide, ""That's where Sonny bono died"" 
 
All is quiet on New Years day, think I'll try and impress my mates 
So I jump into the lake, I won't do that again, here we go again.... 
 
The south shore has the lot, and last month Dave Lee Roth did a solo spot 
And some German bloke got shot, every year we say the same 
""Try somewhere different for a change"", but we jump on to the plane

A,Jason's Addiction,"

Pretty scary how they know you, it depends who you talk to 
From the end to the beginning, only happy when we're singing 
 
Smiling for the camera, crazy silly monsters, they think everything is great 
Black and white not colour, eight times ten, no bigger, not tonight it ain't 
 
You can try and put the face on, you can talk but it all goes wrong 
You can put it in an album, like the ""90's never happened"" 
 
Everything is easy, but they don't believe me, I think I deserve a say 
Beds are made for sharing, but I'm way past caring, not tonight it ain't 
Not tonight it ain't 
Not tonight it ain't

Not tonight it ain't

On the never ever, pretty good together, not tonight it aint

Your Miles Away 
 
I'm Not messing about, got a mile of self doubt 
Yeah, you're not even close, yeah 
Because you're miles away 
 
Another day in bed, sorting out your head 
You don't know what you're talking about 
 
You're not right all of the time 
It's funny when you're wrong 
 
You're miles away, no-one can stop me 
It's far from funny when you're falling over 
 
Yeah, the robot voice, and the peoples choice 
Yeah you blink and it goes wrong 
Because you're miles away 
 
You're not even warm, human after all 
You don't know what you're talking about 
 
You're not right all of the time 
It's funny when you're wrong 
 
You're miles away, no-one can stop me 
So far from funny when you're falling over 
 
I'm too skint to pay my debtors, uh-oh un-opened letters 
Feels like a siege I'm under, how did you get my number? 
Oh-oh it's for the better, than on the never ever 
I'll get back and back and back and back and back, around we go 
 
You're not right all of the time

A,Getting Around,"

All your friends are famous, you're the man at pulling favours 
Is that the best that you could do? Is that the best we can do? 
You say it before, and say it again 
""You're gonna be massive it's a matter of when"" 
Is that the best we could do? Do we owe it all to you? 
 
You're getting around, you're getting me down 
 
It's not that you're used to failure, you put the hours in the cheques come later 
That's the best that you can do? It's time to take on something new? 
You're moving in circles, you're all over LA 
You're big with the ladies, so they don't think you're gay 
Is that the best you could do? And do we owe it all to you? 
 
You're getting around, you're getting me down 
You're getting around, you're getting me down 
 
And when it don't work out, you put them on the stand 
Its not you're fault you got them eating from your hand 
You say the words, and everybody leaves (I'm not ""your boy"" and that's not the point) 
You change your hair, you fully rock a weave 
You don't make sense and you don't want to know 
You're self defensive, oh-uh 
 
You're getting me down, you're getting around 
You're getting me down, you're getting around 
Is that the best you can do? Do we owe it all to you?

6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train 
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same? 
To the right there's a sign, telling me which way to go 
To the left there's an old man shouting at the radio 
The radioooo-oh  
 
Get out, get out, get out, yeah  
 
6 o'clock on a tube stop, waiting for a subway train 
On my own, so alone, why does everybody look the same? 
There's a man with a gold band, but he's got his eye on mine 
There a bomb in a sports bag, could go off at any time - at any time!  
 
When my knees don't work, I start to shake 
I won't panic, I won't hesitate 
It's alright, it's OK 
The daylight is that way 
We all go the same way  
 
6 O'12 and I'm not well, gonna have a heart attack 
Everyone is a bum, I'm gonna get my money back 
Over there there's a square, talking to his telephone 
Then he stares at my hair and suddenly I'm not alone, I'm not alone!  
 
Get out, get out, get out yeah 
Get out, get out, get out!

All over the country, 'cos they took it away

They're playing the records that they play in hospital 
Radio playlist for the terminally ill 
You can't tell they're miming 'till you're over the hill  
 
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...) 
And it goes on (and on, and on, and on...)  
 
If you put it like that, you'll be dead some day 
Set the record straight - they took it all away  
 
They took it away, left us with nothing 
Second-hand hits and million misses 
Nobody means it, they're making up stories 
You gotta blame someone, you can't blame the Tories  
 
I blame myself, I want an easy life 
Does it really matter, ain't worth no suicide 
The bigger they come, the harder they fall 
I'm kicking myself for wasting it all

We've done time for stealing shows 
There ain't nothing we don't know 
Plug us in and watch us go!  
 
C'mon, rock it up, we're all about to jump from the back to the front, go!  
 
So get your, so get your ears on 
So get your, so get your ears on 
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi 
I'm serious, so come on  
 
So get your, so get your ears on 
So get your, so get your ears on 
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi 
I'm serious, bring it on!  
 
Hot, like the desert sky 
You're so cool on the inside 
You hate being recognised 
Going off on outside  
 
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out 
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out 
Gotta get up, gotta get out, picking it up, gotta get up, gotta get out 
Got a fever and I want to clear my lungs!  
 
Coming round for one more go 
Way too loud for radio 
Mosh pit full of casualties 
OAP's get in for free 
Time to even out the score 
Thought we'd done enough before 
Now we're kicking down your door  
 
Come on, rock it up, to the back 
Measure twice, cut it once 
Clear the room, we're barbequeing up for lunch!  
 
So get your, so get your ears on 
So get your, so get your ears on 
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi 
I'm serious, so come on  
 
So get your, so get your ears on 
So get your, so get your ears on 
'Cos I'm Hi-Fi, Hi-Fi 
I'm serious, bring it on!  
 
So get your, so get your ears on 
So get your, so get your ears on

A,Champions Of Endings,"

Don't have the arms for the deep end, 
The walls are [?] around me 
I don't have the balls for the down side 
I don't take it seriously 
We are the champions of endings 
I know where that shit's gonna lead (yeah) 
Don't have no use for pretending

And she said 
Are you alone 
It's alright 
Are you alone

Are you alone

A,Rush Song,"

On and on like a Rush song, like a long one 
You're the miss in the partnership, yeah the right one 
There will come a day when Ill bury you 
I will go the same way, together, 
Whatever there awaits us I'm gonna get through 
 
And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering 
And the closest thing between us is air 
Don't say a word, that's not enough 
 
Makes me sick when I think of it in the wrong way 
Shitting bricks when I enter it in my bad brains 
Like a wound up toy I'm kicking and a screaming 
Emo boy, naive and semi-functioning 
Hey this is a love song, hands up if you feel it. 
 
And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering 
And the closest thing between us is air 
Don't say a word, that's not enough 
 
And the closest thing to Jesus is suffering 
And the closest thing between us is air 
And the moment that's between us is everything 
Don't say a word, that's not enough

That laugh at my behaviour.

A,Art Of Making Sense,"

There's an angel on the corner  
And they say she's watching over  
Over when we are under  
Fall asleep on the ground  
 
[Pre chorus:] 
Hey  
Can you feel it calling your name  
Like a storm on a bone in the rain  
The pain now going you're not around  
 
[Chorus:] 
Wide awake for the night again  
Awake for the night again  
Hanging on the phone i can't wait a minute longer  
Gonna teach you the art of making sense  
 
I gotta rock another city  
I gotta break another country  
I'm gonna kick it til i'm 50  
Or i'm deep in the ground  
 
[Pre chorus:] 
Hey  
Not another bone for the pain  
I'm never drinking again  
It don't make sense when you're not around

A,Die Tonight,"

Lose yourself, save yourself.  
One more night, one more time.  
By yourself, no one else.  
One arrival time to hear you cry tonight.  
 
Pray today, slide away.  
And hide away, no one came.  
Holy graves, maiden names.  
Take a breath and hold it in and out again.  
 
And if you die, alone tonight.  
I'll be right, by your side.  
My advice, alone tonight.  
Wait a while save a life.  
 
Take yourself, you hate yourself.  
Lie awake, wide awake.  
Bruise yourself, lose yourself.  
Pressure's on but not for long remind yourself.  
 
And if you die, alone tonight.  
I'll be right, by your side.  
My advice, alone tonight.  
Wait a while save a life.  
 
Daylight's fading, angels waiting.  
Breaking all the plans we're making  
Daylight's fading, angels waiting.  
Breaking all the plans we're making  
 
And if you die, alone tonight.

A,2nd Coming,"

Listing up you people can't be wrong 
Fuck it up punk rockers hear my song 
One of us united from the heart or it 
Real enough when the spotlights on 
 
Get fists in the air, make out like you care 
You give all you got but you don't want to be here 
That constant surprise, that look in your eyes 
You're the second coming but you ain't mine 
 
Sometimes I look to the sky 
I'm a man not a mountain and that's why 
Cause you get what you give and I like what I got 
And I bet you believe when the crowd roar 
 
Get fists in the air, make out like you care 
You give all you got but you don't want to be here 
That constant surprise, that look in your eyes 
You're the second coming but you ain't mine 
You're so cool in other ways when you're recognized 
 
Get fists in the air, make out like you care 
You give all you got but you don't want to be here 
That constant surprise, that look in your eyes 
You're the second coming but you ain't mine

And that's all you do

You never get lonely 'cause nobody gets you 
Wake up, wake up 
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you 
 
The weight has been hard on your back 
You're wearing well out of respect 
Slowly it's dragging you down 
 
I'd never call it that 
You're running away and you feel 
The voices are way too loud 
 
You never do nothing 
(Hey) 
And that's all you do 
(Hey) 
 
You never get lonely 'cause nobody gets you 
Wake up, wake up 
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you 
 
I can be sorry for this 
So give me the pain I will swallow it 
I can be taller than this 
So light up the way, I will grow with it 
 
I can hail Mary's for this 
So I can remain always positive 
I can be smarter than this 
And then I can be on my 
 
Way, way, falling for it positively 
Moment that I saw you in the way 
Oh, way, oh, way, oh, way 
 
You never do nothing and that's all you do 
You never get lonely and nobody gets you 
Wake up, wake up 
 
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you 
Wake up, wake up 
Bell tolls for you, bell tolls for you

Out of rhythm, feels like prison

A,Worst Thing That Can Happen,"

Standing with the top line  
You know it's gonna hurt when i close my eyes  
And i'm shaking, and i feel so alive

You find yourself caught in the spotlight  
You try to fight but you cant delight the phase  
On your knees is what you're not  
Keeping what you got  
Don't try to hide your face  
Caught in a flashlight  
You know it's gonna hurt when i close my eyes  
And i'm breaking, and i feel so alive  
 
Stand up and face it  
Get up, don't waste it  
What's the worst thing that could happen

Et dans ton business, pas d'bluff, pas d'keuf 
Mais bonne tÃªte, bon pied bon Åil 
Dompter, faut p't'Ãªtre, l'orgueil 
Car tu vois des tas de minettes donc tu n'as mÃªme pas 2 minutes 
Tu ne te fais pas de bile mais ta femme n'avale pas la pilule 
C'est fou quand tout s'Ã©croule autour de nous 
Sur le coup, on tient fiÃ¨rement toujours debout 
Ton mariage passe Ã  l'opinel pour une ado Ã  demi nue 
Tu ne te sens pas dÃ©sirÃ©, tu crois que le drame se dilue 
Tout compte fait, tu prÃ©fÃ¨re parler d'art 
Je te fÃ©liciterai plus tard, j'ai peur de t'parler mal

Mais bon, v'la l'actualitÃ©

J'bosse ma musique avec ma brousse, j'kicke 
Hey, GÃ©gÃ©, Greg, la forme ? 
J'ai ramenÃ© les pairs pour baiser les faibles 
Vous allez kiffer la teille, l'actu est fat

Toujours foncedÃ©, toujours couche-tard

J'ai le flow qui t'bousille et j'fais une promo sur les prothÃ¨ses 
En maison d'disque il parait qu'Ã§a parle 
Bons ou mauvais, on est tranquilles mais attendez qu'Ã§a braille 
J'viens faire bouffer sa planche de surf Ã  Brice 
(Alors, Ã§a farte ?) [?] 
 
On s'check, on se fait la bise 
On s'bÃ©cote, on se dit l'avenir 
On dÃ©conne, on rit Ã  tire-larigot 
Quoi d'neuf mon pote ? Est-ce-que Ã§a va ? 
Moi Ã§a va mais c'est le rap qui va pas 
 
Quand on croise les vieux potos, quoi d'neuf ? ""Ãa s'passe !"" 
Les amour et les affaires ? ""Ãa s'tasse !"" 
Et en attendant dans les postes y'a du son, quoi d'neuf ? ""Ãa rame !"" 
T'tracasses, on est al et Ã§a dÃ©chire ""Sa race !""

A2H,"Rap, Weed Et Pizza","

[Cheef:] 
TÃ©ma la procÃ©dure, en principe c'est censÃ© durer 
DÃ©ballage des denrÃ©es [?] brutal, c'est quand j'vais tuer le micro C'est sÃ»r c'est pizza puis cahier, c'est quand j'suis polyvalent 
Du bon son, petit flacon, voilÃ  l'essence qu'on inhale 
ConsÃ©quence, j'suis magique comme Roberto Baggio 
Quasi-obligÃ© sauf la quattro fromaggi oh 
J'ai l'J, cimer tant pis pour les victimes 
A2H, Cheef, Pita, faut pas que j'oublie d'signer 
Mais pour la petite story, sans KO sans victory 
[?] de plus que c'qu'il faut qu'j'te dise d'horrible 
Dites aux sceptiques d'isoler l'micro, tu sais que mon Ã©quipe 
L'immole aussitÃ´t, [?] et on est quitte 
 
[Pitagore:] 
C'est parfois gras mais lÃ  j'kiff l'risque, et puisque j'entre 
Plus dans l'Ã©lastique de mon slip, c'est la triste pente 
Grise quand les graissent glissent entre mes dents, j'fesse 
Quand j'laisse mes envies de grailler tailler sans stress 
Freestyle, j'plie c'deux yeufs, plisse, le keuf 
Prise de l'Åil et vite, me fist quand je flip mal 
Fils t'as mille textes kickÃ©s, d'exquises 
Rimes aiguisÃ©es sur des flics et des slips sales 
Fils tailles vite, si t'as la mine niquÃ©e 
Pas d'canard 'part si t'es l'ami d'Mickey 
T'es collant tu m'uses, abuser plus d'un fusil 
Cherche la pizza, weed, 'teille d'eau qui perce l'univers 
C'est A2H, Cheef, Pita dans la partie gare 
Si tu rates le hit, t'as captÃ© la rÃ©partie 
DÃ¨s le dÃ©part, t'aimes le hit nique le tac mÃªme 
T'aimes pizza, weed, Ã©vite de rap man 
 
[A2H:] 
Coca-Cola, Haschisch et lignes de textes 
On prend du bide aux rimes et mate le style qu'on laisse 
Sur le gimmick jazz, on imite pas, on dÃ©bite grave 
T'imagines pas le nombre de types qu'on vexe 
J'vais Ã©couter du George Clinton, rapper sur un breakbeat 
Les fÃªtes cheep on reste hyper-cool, pas des mecs flippants 
J'kiff ma 4 fromages, de la phase trop hard 
Le naze comate, genre acrobate, j'mets des claques au mic 
SoÃ»lant comme un alcoolique, des fois fÃ©roce 
Pitbull ouf, rien Ã  foutre qu'les marmots kiffent 
T'faÃ§on j'suis encore un mÃ´me, j'aime rien branler, bouffer 
Mater des gros boules, taper des grosses douilles 
Les voisins crient ""au secours"", j'suis au courant, tant pis pour eux 
Mais j'partirai pas en courant si ils ramÃ¨nent un flic ou deux 
Bien endurant, pas d'langoureux, y aura peut-Ãªtre l'ambulance 
Si les haineux deviennent trop soÃ»lant j'ai de la phase au chaud pour eux 
 
HÃ© ouais 
A2H, Cheef, Pita

Yo, on a lâRap dans lâsang, les couilles, le cÅur et les tripes 
Câest cool, demande Ã  lâÃ©quipe et cours Ã©couter le hit 
Nekfeu, A2H, on a pas lâtemps, viens quâon tâmette doux 
Nous on te couche comme un lendemain dâconcert 
 
[Couplet 1 : Nekfeu] 
Vâla Nek, Ã©parpillez-vous, Ã§a câest plus quâun texte homologuÃ© 
ÃlevÃ© parmi les loups, jâme sens comme Princesse MononokÃ© 
On tÃ©tanise les foules en ramenant plein d'tÃªtes trop colorÃ©es 
Je sais quâParis mâÃ©coute, jâai le flow impÃ©câ pour provoquer 
Profite la vie va vite, lâami, y'a pas dâcroquis facile 
Je sais quâlâoligarchie trafique, regarde Ã  qui profite la crise 
Et je maudis la tyrannie de leur lobby quasi-nazi 
Quand la police applique la dictature au prix dâma vie dâartiste 
Jâai la phobie dâlâhorrible avenir mais les lolitas kiffent ma bite 
Jâsuis Ã©goÃ¯ste ma pâtite, jâai vu Ben Ã  lâhÃ´pital psychiatrique 
Jâai dans ma tÃªte de Grec des scÃ¨nes qui te fâraient rougir de honte 
Avant quâles bougies ne fondent, Ã©coute les soupirs de lâombre 
Quand jâÃ©cris pas des textes dÃ©primants, jâdÃ©cris la fÃªte, fils 
Effectivement, jâai mille facettes et des rÃªves immenses 
Jâpose la rime avec lâami A2H 
Grosse famille nostalgique, on te bannit par le clash *clap clap* 
Sache quâon arrache les pages mÃªme quand les types sâenfoncent 
Pas la peine de sucer, dÃ©gage, les grands MC's sârencontrent

[Couplet 2 : A2H] 
Yo, yo, Ã§a rappe avec les tripes, en Ã©quipe, toujours le kiff pour lâÃ©thique 
On kicke depuis tit-pe, Ã§a rythme nos iv 
Des histoires de biff et de miss, de shit et de mif' 
Ca glisse, fun ou bien triste, tranquille ou risquÃ© 
A2H, Nekfeu, câest dâla barbarie 
Aussi vrai quâjâsuis grave marron, classique comme l'Atari 
On dÃ©gage les gus gÃªnants dans les rues, errants 
Le but câest pas les putes, mais nan, une instru, un truc mÃ©chant 
Et tu scrutes mon gang 
LÃ¢che-moi la grappe que je plane, que je fume mon bang 
Jâabuse, jâmâen branle, jâmitraille lâassemblÃ©e, appelle-moi Terminator 
Ã mi-châmin entre Peter Tosh et Herbie Hancock 
Zonard, jânâai mÃªme pas le permis en poche 
Jâsuis ready en tout cas, apte rÃ©gner en boss 
Taper le top, craner, rafler le coffre 
Baffer le score, on a la dalle, venus enfoncer les portes 
Easy, MC-Beatmaker, jâfais ma cuisine 
Câest risible de voir les nazes cracher sur le buzz 
Mise tout sur nous et appuie sur le buzzer 
A2H, Nekfeu, on te met la dose, yeah

A2H,Fonsdar,"

Yeah... c'est pour mes fonsdar, vas y crame ta weed ! 
 
Yo okay ! 
Jack herrer, indica ou shiva shanti, joint de shit gras, white widow, chacun son style 
Ãa roule et Ã§a fume tous le monde Ã  les yeux bridÃ©s 
Les ongles noirs, le comptoir vient le cendrier 
J'ai mal au bide, la beu me donne la dalle ! 
Je file au fastfood pour un casse croÃ»te et je roule du nÃ©palais et mon cerveau n'est plus carrÃ© ! 
Je titube dans les transports j'suis pas net ou cramÃ© sur le palet 
D'la merde sous le colon on Ã©vite les poulets 
La caisse sent la beu, normal l'amnÃ©sia sous le volant 
C'est pour les fonsdar qui ne trouvent pas le sommeil sans stick de verte 
Effrite s'teuplait 
Pousse la basse la piste me plait 
C'est pour ceux qui font chauffer le cutter sur le rÃ©chaud 
Les go fast, les cultivateurs, les gros pochons 
Ãa parfume les couilles, oui les passants me r'gardent 
Ãa me rend parano, il faut changer le matos de place 
Si toi tu peux pas t'empÃªcher d'fumer dans le rer 
Shit dans le g-star, vodka dans le revet okay 
Fume fume fume jusqu'Ã  cracher des glaires ! 
Fume fume fume il faut cramer cette herbe ! 
 
Laisser moi fumer mon spliff de zeb' 
C'est c'est ! c'est le hit qui vient du baaang ! 
V'la l'rap de fonsdar lÃ¨ve ton pÃ©tard si t'es pÃ©tÃ© au shit 
En cas de contrÃ´le je prÃ©fÃ¨re l'avaler que laisser aux flics 
Y doit me rester un stick 
J'vais le fumer avant de sortir, Ã§a m'Ã©vitera de rester hostile (x2) 
 
Les yeux plissÃ©s on fait peur aux gosses 
On est bien robuste, on encaisse les cÃ´nes avec les cops au cul 
Si toi tu enfumes ton arrÃªt de bus ou ton hall 
Trouves pas d'excuse si t'es stone 
Tous les pillons sont dÃ©gomÃ©s 
Une flaque marron dans le gobelet 
Dans le roulage on est rodÃ© 
Trop bonne odeur, bientÃ´t loadÃ© 
On aime rodÃ© roulÃ© boulÃ© mattÃ© le gros boule des Â« zoulettes Â» 
En Â« doly Â» vient la boulette 
Pou-pou-poulette ! aprÃ¨s c'est roulÃ© boulÃ© sous la cou-ette arg ! 
Enfume la tribune de ton stade avec ton staff 
Un sliff de hash, un fumi et c'est Bagdad ! 
Ici c'est paname ! 
Si qui t'es en garde av' 
Si t'es trop black ou arabe la BAC t'marrave 
Si t'es gÃ©-char, le loqui dans la tess man 
PÃ©tÃ© dans nos tÃªtes, bouffÃ© par le sheitan 
Viens au spectacle, l'A2H fumeur de maji-ruana ! 
J'en place une pour mes fonsdÃ©, me voila ! yeah !

A2H,Flying High,"

Okay ! Yo ! La foncdÃ© me prend les tripes 
Je plane et rigole, c'est pas du cinoche 
Je vise ce truc depuis que je suis mioche 
Je pioche dans mon sachet d'herbe, quand tout est assez terne 
C'est vrai que je suis assez faible, en effet tÃ©ma les cernes 
La city m'aliÃ¨ne je quitte Paris, ma rivale 
[?] la weed a deux pas de la mer, loin de mon habitat 
Kamikaze, des fois dans un sale Ã©tat v'la minable 
Mais lamina des truc a crachÃ© quand j'inhale ! 
Ãa reste ouf quand je pars un univers s'ouvre 
C'est moi la zer je souffle, c'est vrai la zeb' [?] 
T'aimes pas mon mode de vie, j'ai quelques grandes devises 
Je roule avec les miens, Palacela grande mif 
PÃ©tÃ© a la white, jamais un verre de tise 
Tu craches t'es une pute toi et ton gang de milf 
DÃ©foncÃ©, je nargue. J'essaie de vendre des disques 
Mais si tu le cherches pas, il sera pas mÃ©chant le mÃ©tisse 
 
I'm flying flying 
I'm flying so high 
I'm flying flying 
I'm flying so high 
I'm flying flying 
I'm flying so high 
I'm flying flyiiiing 
 
Ok ! Et c'est toujours la mÃªme histoire 
La foncdÃ© prime pour le lyricale, dreadlocks pour mon hÃ©ritage 
Ãa reste banal, je suis juste un banlieusard malade 
Toujours la banane quand je balade 
DÃ©jÃ  fait trop de truc, jamais vraiment net 
DÃ©jÃ  mangÃ© trop de bÃ»che la life est vraiment laide 
J'ai commencÃ© en bus, je finirais en Bentley 
Faya sur un sample, un kick, une caisse claire 
Du hachich dans le sang, je suis pas clean dans les rangs 
Des tas de rimes dans les dents et devant les dangers je prend les devants 
De toute faÃ§on je suis dÃ©sinhibÃ©, j'ai les crocs ! 
Demande a la mama, car c'est d'elle, que je l'ai hÃ©ritÃ© 
Mais si j'obtiens tout, est-ce que je l'aurais mÃ©ritÃ© ? 
J'passe la moitiÃ© d'mon temps a faire des dÃ©bilitÃ©s 
DÃ©foncÃ©s. Jamais vraiment militÃ© 
Et devant mes pÃ©ripÃ©ties j'finis souvent dÃ©pitÃ© 
 
I'm flying flying 
I'm flying so high 
I'm flying flying 
I'm flying so high 
I'm flying flying 
I'm flying so high 
I'm flying flyiiiing

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
 
Ce matin j'ai pas la tÃªte dans l'cul 
Hier j'ai laissÃ© un hit dans l'stud, putain j'ai du biff en plus 
Ma meuf me fait un strip en jupe 
Ma journÃ©e commence bien, je suis loin de mon existence nulle 
Le frigo est blindÃ©, poulet, boeuf, tortillas, tapas olive 
J'ai de la weed, j'salue les condÃ©s, avec un smile d'enfant 
J'me pavane en dansant 
Ma jambe s'Ã©lanÃ§ant j'suis pas insolent j'sens 
Que je suis bien dans mes baskets, loin des ambiance lass-dÃ©g 
J'ai le smile j'en suis presque Ã  faire des claquettes 
Tout est facile je me sens beau, si Ã§a tise j'veux du champagne, du Barry White 
Tout est permis pas de mises en garde 
Mon son tourne, ouais je vois que les bitch en parlent 
So cool, y'a ma race sur les pancartes 
J'ai croisÃ© l'Maf il a l'air bien aussi 
Poto vient au stud, qu'on fÃªte Ã§a en roulant un gros stick 
 
Aujourd'hui c'est une bonne journÃ©e 
Aujourd'hui c'est une bonne journÃ©e 
Aujourd'hui c'est une bonne journÃ©e

Bonne journÃ©e 
 
La lueur du soleil vient me chatouiller les paupiÃ¨res 
Un espace dans le volet fait se reflÃ©ter la lumiÃ¨re 
Comme tous les matins j'ai la barre, j'me rÃ©veille de bonne humeur 
Mise Ã  jour du disque dur, une cigarette, un coca pur 
Un son [?] milles saveurs, j'rallume mon pilon du soir 
Une bonne journÃ©e s'annonce, j'ai le cÅur ouvert plein d'espoirs 
Une priÃ¨re pour les gens que j'aime mÃªme ceux que je n'connais pas 
Mon tÃ©lÃ©phone sonne, une petite voix m'appelle Papa 
Douche fraÃ®che, petite chemise, referme les portes de l'appart 
Le soleil fait sortir les jupes, lunettes noires je mate 
Mon quartier est si beau quand dans ma tÃªte j'me sens si bien 
SapÃ© de la tÃªte au pied, je me balade pur style d'ancien 
Croise A2 au fast-food, comme Ã  son habitude 
Me dit passe Ã  la baraque pour y cramer un spliff de weed 
J'connais dÃ©jÃ  la fin du bail, rap, fumÃ©e, flash de Sky 
Aujourd'hui est une bonne journÃ©e, sur mon nuage je fly 
 
Aujourd'hui c'est une bonne journÃ©e 
Aujourd'hui c'est une bonne journÃ©e

Douce dans la poche, insolent j'avias des blÃ¢mes en retour 
J'voulais juste me faire sucer par ma copine 
Me faire passer pour ton fils, dans ma chambre cache le gros shit 
En suite Bob me rend fou, j'suis naturel et mystique

Oui j'quitte la school, pense rap, myst and groove 
Roquet d'banlieu Ã  Paris et les pipes quand j'roule 
Le RER avec mon shit dans l'boule 
Certains s'disaient : ""Il est nuisant s'boug, oui Ã©vitons c'fou"" 
C'est marrant, j'ai jamais aimÃ© les gens 
Rien Ã  foutre d'Ãªtre Ã©legant

Je fantasme une vie de rÃªve, oÃ¹ les ruelles me parleraint 
OÃ¹ le metro me dirait bonjour, oÃ¹ j'serai bien dans l'RER 
La beuh serait gratuite, j'dormirais dans des grandes suites 
Avec un compte dans une banque suisse 
Et il n'y aurait que des bonnes cuites 
La banlieue Sud-Est brillerait comme Las Vegas 
Remplace les barres de bÃ©ton par des palaces classes 
Ouais rien de tout Ã§a 
Ce n'est qu'une untopie j'suis dans le RER B avec une pipe Ã  weed 
 
Le soleil se couche la rage me ronge le bide 
La nuit me bouffe et j'aime Ã§a j'fais trembler la ville sous mes bruits de pas 
 
Le soleil se couche la rage me ronge le bide 
La nuit me bouffe et j'aime Ã§a j'fais trembler la ville sous mes bruits de pas

A2H,Pas De Questions Sans RÃ©ponses,"

Okay, YO ! J'en ai vu des larmes, des drames 
Des calvalcades de paroles nazes 
Des parents crevÃ©s, des carences massives 
L'insolence aggripe, le silence Ã©fritte 
Dans mes rues j'ai vu les plus forts et les pires 
Des musculors et des ptits 
Peu d'support pour l'Ã©quipe 
Insultant parait il 
On Ã©tait averti avant content et puis maintenant on a l'air triste 
6 pieds sous terre un spliff de Zeb' pour l'apparence joviale 
Un ptit peu de zÃ¨le c'est plus marrant quand on s'dÃ©fonce 
J'laisse pas d'questions sans rÃ©ponses 
Si le soir on est en groupe 
C'est parce que seul on a les boules 
On prend d'la drogue car on est tout naze 
Quand on est sobre on a la trouille ca c'est sur 
On est jamais vraiment Ã  la cool, matte 
L'allure de ma troupe sale 
On s'moque de tout et on est fier 
On reste fou mÃªme quand c'est sÃ©rieux 
On dort le jour et on a des cernes vieux 
La vraie vie n'est pas tentante alors on s'rasure on tente on glande 
On brandit des slogans sans s'rendre compte qu'on 
Est bancal, brutal et on bande devant des bukakes 
Un tas d'putins d'infos crasseuses qu'on trouve trop sensass' 
Des fois une femme nous aime Ã  quoi ca sert 
Elle va partir pour une vie plus censÃ© 
Plus envie d'Ãªtre trop sincÃ¨re 
On veut rien faire toujours l'impression d'Ãªtre asservis 
C'est vraiment dur d'rendre un service tout va super vite 
On s'permet d'juger les gens car on en a rien a foutre que ta click de nazes elle montre les dents ouai 
Ici certains vendent de la dope, rien Ã  faire d'autres 
Certains la tape pour vivre les longs hiver glauques 
Ves-qui les upercuts, un chemin super flou, y'a plus d'air pur, mÃªme si t'es sobre 
Ouais elle pu la turbe 
Moi je fais danser le peuple j'massure qu'il vide le pub 
J'oublie la merde, des frÃ¨res dÃ©bite le seum 
Mais d'autres y perdent on s'en tape 
Mais putain on a le smile j'me rÃ©jouie d'1 spliff, d'2 Haagen Dazs 
Allume le mic et j'vai t'gueuler qu'on a la dale 
J'suis comme tout le monde, j'veux faire plaisir Ã  la daronne 
Oui j'suis pas hype avec ce trac et ya pas d'carotte 
J'en place un pour les miens et Ã§a Ã§a s'arrose 
BORDEL ! C'est la fin du texte, j'ai une life Ã  tarot 
J'emmerde le monde,j'assume mes fautes, j'enferme mes songes 
Et ronge cette vie de con ,j't'offre de mon monde dans mes concerts 
 
C'est A2H bande d'enfoirÃ©s, j'oublierai rien, aussi bien les rÃ©ussites que les trucs foirÃ©s... 
C'est A2H bande d'enfoirÃ©s, j'oublierai rien, aussi bien les rÃ©ussites que les trucs foirÃ©s...

A2H,Presque Comme Toi,"

Yeah, Twinztrack Ã  la prod' 
J'suis Ã  l'arrache comme tout le monde... ou presque 
Yeah, c'est le A, le 2, le H en personne, yeah, yo... 
Vas-y, c'est parti 
 
Yo, la piaule est crade, des cendars, des restes de pizza 
Les soutifs, les strings de madame au pied du lit stagnent 
Ãa sent la bouffe et la fumÃ©e 
Y'a plus d'courses dans le go-fri, c'est la loose mais j'sais l'assumer 
C'est pas stylÃ©, c'est juste [?] Ã  part 
D'un type curieusement dÃ©calÃ©, Ã  l'arrache, aimant la graille 
Vivant la night entre loups, pÃ©tant la rage, j'chante le blues 
J'aime l'asphalte certes, souvent Ã  la case, j'manque de flouze 
Mais c'est pas grave, j'tente le tout pour le tout mÃªme si je loupe mon rÃ©veil 
J'rappe, je ride, je graille, j'fous le souk quand j'exerce 
J'rentre Ã  pattes, avec le bus, en effet 
Zyeutant des fesses, j'retrouve ma case et j'bute un dessert 
Nuage de fumÃ©e opaque et j'file au pieu 
J'ai rien fait de grand, je sais, mais j'fais au mieux 
J'veux juste survivre, Ã©viter l'odieux, finir sur une Ã®le, goÃ»ter l'eau bleue 
Du kiff, du biff et monter aux cieux 
 
J'suis Ã  l'arrache comme tout le monde 
J'me pÃ¨te la tÃªte et je gÃ¢che le cash 
Alors foulons le bitume, les longs couloirs du mÃ©tro jusqu'au plumard 
Le A, le 2, le H, j'suis comme toi mais en plus barge 
 
Yo, j'vis en dÃ©calÃ© des miss, des mÃ´mes, des types clean 
J'croise que des bandits, des vils-ci et des mystiques 
J'habite dans l'reureu, mon salon c'est le hall de gare 
Dans l'fond heureux, j'me couche quand les lÃ¨ves-tÃ´t se barrent 
Cette vie est comme la tienne mais Ã  l'envers 
Quand tu chies, moi, je baise, quand tu dors, moi, j'pars en guerre 
Des fois cool, des fois saoulant, j'perds la boule assez souvent 
Un genre de zombie, ouais, j'sors d'un film d'Ã©pouvante 
A2H mÃ©lange la folie, l'amour 
Et j'ai toujours mon stick Ã  la bouche, chÃ©rie, quand j'fais la bouffe 
Toujours bouillant, il faut qu'j'me pose, que j'lache du lest 
J'essaye mÃªme plus d'faire le casse du siÃ¨cle 
 
J'suis Ã  l'arrache comme tout le monde 
J'me pÃ¨te la tÃªte et je gÃ¢che le cash 
Alors foulons le bitume, les longs couloirs du mÃ©tro jusqu'au plumard 
Le A, le 2, le H, j'suis comme toi mais en plus barge 
 
J'rentre Ã  pattes avec le bus 
Je graille, je fous le souk... Nuage de fumÃ©e opaque 
J'habite dans l'reureu... Mon salon, c'est le hall de gare 
A2H 
 
J'suis dans mon univers, entre la folie, le sens 
Et des jolies dÃ©penses, des orgies, dÃ©foncÃ© 
Il est possible que j'encaisse mal et que j'finisse fou 
Mais j'serais pas pire que vous, c'est comme imprÃ©cis et flou 
Et demain repeat boug, nos vies mystiques roulent 
Et tous les jours les mÃªmes discours, Ã§a m'brise, Ã§a m'saoule 
J'suis entre gentil et chiant, bandit et tendre 
En dilettante, tranquille et lent oÃ¹ j'm'excite et m'lance

A2H,Bipolaire,"

La maladie bipolaire, c'est un dÃ©reglement de l'humeur 
Il y a des personnes pour qui on n'arrive pas Ã  obtenir comme Ã§a, une humeur stable et constante 
 
Yeah, j'rappe sur tout, du Boom Bap Ã  la West 
Tant que Ã§a groove et que j'kiff la boucle, le kick, le charley, la caisse 
J'me dis ""Ce beat fera l'affaire"", c'est dit, j'allume la mÃ¨che et rime 
Dieu fera le reste, c'est clean, il claquera le texte, Ã§a brille 
Que je sois lent ou rapide #TexAvery 
Que je sois clean, ou qu'on me dise ""Qu'est-ce que t'as pris ?!"" 
Avec Grem's ou Meksa Peal 
J'rappe avec tout le monde, tant que je rappe et que la foule gronde 
J'aime te raconter ma vie et des fois j'fais le bouffon 
Je suis un nemo kid, j'ai des phases qui chialent 
Demande Ã  Fatou, Ã©rotique, sa weed, demande Ã  ma poule 
La weed demande Ã  Mafos, gros bide Ã  la Carlos 
En pleine dÃ©pression quand on roule dans le gamos 
J'veux des prods tristes, j'en ai marre de l'Ã©gotrip 
DÃ¨s le lendemain un nouveau hit, Ã©clatÃ© par Ludacris 
J'veux faire comme lui 
J'sors la [?] 
Et cette story, c'est le dilemne de ma vie 
 
T'aimes quand j'ai du flow, tu prÃ©fÃ¨res quand j'ai du fond 
J'peux te parler de mes soces, ou te faire manger du bon 
Rapper, chanter, lÃ¢cher du son, ou sexy la sÃ©duction 
J'suis Bipolaire mais je chante sur l'outro, Ã§a passe en introduction

J'suis Bipolaire mais je chante sur l'outro, Ã§a passe en introduction 
 
J'suis bipolaire, je suis entre rage et joie 
En espÃ©rant devenir une sorte de star, et je crie dans le porte voix 
C'est dur, embÃªtant, c'est sÃ»r en cherchant, j'vais trouver 
Je lutte en mÃªme temps, sur le fond, la forme, le beat s'en mÃ¨le quand 
Y'a plus de son, j'contrÃ´le pas mon inspi 
La musique donne les instructions, j'me pose et j'inspire 
Juste Ã  cÃ´tÃ© d'un stylo, d'une limo ou d'un stick 
Je ris, je pleure, je fais Ã§a depuis que j'ai 15 piges 
Mon style est simple, ouais, j'fais d'la bipolaire musique 
Soit un freestyle, soit un thÃ¨me et dans les deux je fusille 
La foudre dans ma pupille, une MPC devant un pupitre 
J'amorce le truc, j'le bute, et lÃ  tu piges 
Des fois futile, des fois tu cogites grave 
J'passe de Katsuni Ã  Heather Brooke, c'est vrai que je suis trop vicellard 
Oui je torture ma femme, j'improvise grave 
DrÃ´le d'histoire, j'serais soit au stud, soit au lit ce soir

Euphorique ou mÃ©lancolique 
Je suis dans clean ou chez mon grossiste 
Bien en vie ou Ã  l'agonie 
J'Ã©coute Wu Tang et Young Money 
Snoop Dogg, Dolla, Nas et Mobb Deep 
Ambiance joyeuse ou bien glauque 
Viens chez oim mater mes croquis 
Bipolaire je suis mon propre sosie, Yeah !

A2H,Mon Rap,"

J'mets tout dans mon rap 
Tu veux savoir qui j'suis : Ã©coute mes tracks 
Hell Maf Ã  la prod'... Palace 
 
Yo ! J'fais pas d'cinÃ©ma quand l'bide est rongÃ© 
MÃªme si c'est dangereux, j'ai domptÃ© mes dÃ©mons dans la pÃ©nombre 
Et j'ai comptÃ© mes fautes, jeune effrontÃ©, j'rÃ©chauffe 
Mes souvenirs, tous mes croquis 
Oui, j'accuserais bien mon grossiste mais j'suis autre 
Et c'est ni Ã  cause de l'hydro ou l'hydromel 
Pas du style mytho pour un clito dans un p'tit hÃ´tel ! 
La nuit j'opÃ¨re, concentrÃ© mais pas l'type austÃ¨re 
J'ai pris trop d'air avec la vie, d'puis minot j'rÃªve 
Vadrouiller en vaisseau, mais j'ouvre les yeux et j'vois des potes 
Qui s'font ter-sau, les tasses-pÃ©, les coups d'taissons, les minots Ã©coutent tes sons 
Et tu kiffes ! 
Mais tu switch vite, quand t'es tout seul avec ton dwich' - frites ! 
J'connais la fin dans l'fond, toujours la mort dans l'film 
Mon corps a l'shop dans [?] , mais j'fais pas d'score dans l'crime 
J'ai vu l'amour dans les yeux d'une brune, j'ai enfin compris 
J'essaye juste de vivre les bons trip. Yeah ! 
 
I just wanna sing my soul (singing the soul) 
Hope is behind my door 
There's some trouble in my verses 
Just my life and nothing more 
 
I just wanna sing my soul (singing the soul) 
Hope is behind my door 
There's some trouble in my verses 
Just my life and nothing more 
 
Les gens m'dÃ©goÃ»tent, j'aime pas trop la foule 
J'suis mÃªme souvent partant pour Ãªtre absent j'avoue 
Mais J'aime rouler dans une auto 
La dÃ©fonce est Ã  propos, accompagnÃ© d'un bon poto 
Pas dÃ©faitiste il est trop tÃ´t 
Je ne connais rien ! Laisse moi dÃ©couvrir et souder encore les liens 
Avec mes croyances moi j'adore les miens, j'les trouve hardcore les tiens 
A priori je suis ouvert mais ... la bougie a forcÃ© l'teint 
Putain, j'rap sur tout, mÃªme sur des sons que t'aimes pas 
J'aime autant la G-Funk que le rap de BÃ¨s-bar ! ! 
Moi je zone entre trop d'ambiances, qui ne me cernent pas 
Boug deter' si tu me testes : tu ne me baises pas 
J'suis simplement un banlieusard, pÃ©tÃ© Ã  la niaks. Hannn 
Un peu trop ouvert, loin des carcans, j'trouve tout le monde tout cheum 
Mic Ã  la main, j'vadrouille souvent tout seul 
 
I just wanna sing my soul (singing the soul) 
Hope is behind my door 
There's some trouble in my verses 
Just my life and nothing more 
 
I just wanna sing my soul (singing the soul) 
Hope is behind my door 
There's some trouble in my verses 
Just my life and nothing more 
 
Dans la merde on entre Ã  100 on repart Ã  10 
Demande au chauffeur combien d'stations avant le paradis 
Le rap l'asile ou j'rÃ©side, c'est magique quand j'rÃ©cite 
Soit c'est triste soit j'm'excite sur le track, c'est dit 
J'suis l'genre de MC qui aime quand le wack frÃ©mis 
La j'balance mes casses-dÃ©di : A ceux qui dÃ©taillent encore les grammes de weed 
Et les tous reufs qui galÃ¨rent Ã  la boÃ®te d'IntÃ©rim 
 
I just wanna sing my soul (singing the soul) 
Hope is behind my door 
There's some trouble in my verses 
Just my life and nothing more 
 
I just wanna sing my soul (singing the soul)

Burbigo: v'lÃ  mon nickname 
RamÃ¨ne des types, avec l'Ã©quipe j'anesthÃ©sie l'game 
On vise les bigs payes: Bill Gates, Rockefeller 
L'ambition d'un jeune trader, les crocs d'un rottweiler 
Que t'aie la peau crÃ¨me ou la peau rÃ©glisse, nou,s, ce qu'on aime 
C'est les gros leggins, gros dÃ©bits, grosses frayeurs 
Effrite le shit Ã  200 sur l'pÃ©riphÃ©rique 
Pour Ãªtre sÃ©duisant, il faut de l'argent demande Ã  RibÃ©ry 
Moi, je n'ai pas le temps d'squatter le bÃ¢timent 
Parmi les trafiquants, vois c'que je manigance 
Non, j'suis pas lÃ©gal, fais gaffe au passage d'l'agent 
Ratez pas mes gars dÃ©baller, rattrape l'argent 
On fait qu'bosser nos rimes, encore et encore on progresse 
Pour rester en vie bien aprÃ¨s nos enveloppes corporelles 
Et on va l'faire, A2, ouais, on va l'faire 
Jeune pÃ©dÃ©, tu m'dÃ©testes, tant mieux, j'veux pas t'plaire 
Ici, on s'active pour des classiques et des billets verts 
Via la zik tels des supernovas, on va briller, frÃ¨re

Fort depuis longtemps, demande Ã  mon clan 
J'ai du cran, de l'Ã©lan, des diableries dans l'sang 
J'veux un remontant, tu veux du bon sens ? 
J'ai plus d'temps, je t'Ã©ventre d'un air grandiloquent 
J'dois rester debout avec le respect d'tous 
J'sors de ma brousse, j'veux que l'espÃ¨ce coule 
Han, tu veux me test cousin ? 
Cette vie je l'ai Ã©pousÃ©, j'ai les couilles et le coup d'poing 
N'jamais crevÃ©, n'jamais flÃ©chir: c'est juste le mot d'ordre 
Cramer des types sans rÃ©flÃ©chir via les titres qu'on sort 
J'suis assez sceptique quand j'Ã©coute ton bum-al 
Moi, j'apprÃ©cie l'orgasme, j'baise et j'rappe 
J'suis clairement en vie, appÃ©tit de morfal 
Appelle-moi le papa, l'ami patate, facile high Ã  la weed fat 
A la piste j'largue ma shit: Drop it like it's hot 
J'peux pas crever, j'ai dÃ©ja 1000 vies d'avance 
J'ai pas d'billets, faut qu'je fusille la banque 
Sort ton Ã©quipe, Deen et A2 approchent 
Des phases dans la poche, tous les ados attendent 
Prie pour qu'on soit pas trop trash 
Quand j'kicke le Rap Ã  trop d'classe 
En vie j'suis apte Ã  trop d'baffes 
J'doggy l'track et aprÃ¨s m'casse 
SuperhÃ©ros, haineux levez les bras 
J'viens sauver la ville et assommer les wacks 
J'suis dÃ©ter c'est dar, j'vais pÃ©ter des cÃ¢bles 
DÃ©posez les armes, j'viens affoler les chattes 
 
Laisse faire, tu peux pas Ã©galer, frÃ¨re 
EspÃ¨re, tu peux pas nous caner, frÃ¨re 
Tu peux pas Ã©galer, tu peux pas nous caner, frÃ¨re 
On immortalise toutes nos bÃªtises, on s'en bat les steaks ! 
 
Teste pas mon block, chez nous on n'fait qu'des petites horreurs 
Tacle Ã  la gorge, j'suis plus freaky qu'un creepy crawler 
Le Rap est Ã  l'image d'une poitrine en silicone 
Vous n'avez que l'apparence, j'vous vois venir, stupides voleurs 
T'es tout cambrÃ©, MC, t'es comme mon bar, on t'pillave dessus 
Peaufine le style avant de rÃªver d'Austin, de biatch de luxe 
Des cigares de pure, de milliard de thunes, t'es tricard, tu pues 
On t'tire par le pull et t'mitraille le cul ! 
 
Laisse faire, tu peux pas Ã©galer, frÃ¨re

Chill et relax Ã  la cool

C'est banlieue Sud, fume la weed dans les restos ! 
Ca tise des litres dans le mÃ©tro 
Des hits, du rap, de l'Ã©lectro ! 
Les flics sont loins dans les rÃ©tros ! 
J'suis comme un gosse quand y'a du soleil, du pollen dans l'pillon 
Avec mon possy loin des problÃ¨mes, p'tite cheveux chataings mi-longs ! 
J'te parle de kiff c'est tout, de trips, de crew, de tise rÃ©-bou 
Casses toi si t'as des p'tites yeu-cou ! 
Train d'vie dÃ©bile mais l'Ã©thique elle est real 
Mes types viennent d'iÃ§i, d'Afrique et des Ã®les 
On kiffe les chabines maghrÃ©bines et MILF 
D'la bibine, d'la green, on esquive les pills 
YEAH ! 
Juste un track qui a l'sourire pour mes ""Boyz'n the Hood"" 
Quand y'a pas les flics, un peu d'biff, les reufs vont payer des coups 
Blow Job assis sur l'divan, un smile Ã©vidant, casse dalle, entÃªtant 
Non, j'ai pas oubliÃ© l'piment 
J'ai juste envie d'kiffer, Palace Prod Ã  la muerte, la folie, la classe, la mixitÃ© !

Jusqu'Ã  la Happy End. Happy face, happy face ... 
 
Yo ! J'veux un transat' et un cocktail, high en sandales 
Lance la grosse caisse, poser les armes que les gosses naissent 
Avec leurs darons loin d'l'austÃ¨re, c'est comme Ã§a qu'on veut notre quotidien ma gueule ! 
Et pouvoir faire plaisir Ã  la reum. Certes. Ãviter les pleurs 
J'ai hÃ©ritÃ© des peuples africains, dÃ©ssinÃ© les moeurs, demi teint 
J'veux une Happy End, des filles en Ã©tat d'ivresse 
Et oui, Paris laisse nous kiffer, palper la piÃ¨ce. HANN 
Agrippe mon train d'vie, derriÃ¨re la zer-mi c'est paradisiaque 
Je gratte la guitare, rarement fataliste, j'garde le smile 
HOOOO merde, le track est trop souriant, tu m'vois tel un fou riant 
Tout mes doigts touchent sous les jambes 
J'serais p't'Ãªtre en dessous des ventes, mais j'prendrais tout dÃ©tente 
J'lacherais rien et laisserais couler l'temps 
Moi j'rap pour ma family, j'te l'ai dÃ©jÃ  dit 
J'serais extremement ravi, si la tienne aime ma zik. HAN 
J'aime taper des grosses barres, mais n'abuses pas 
Sous les dreadlocks y'a un soldat, qui a vu l'diable 
 
Happy face ! J'ride mon Happy day 
Jusqu'Ã  la Happy End. Happy face, happy face ... 
 
Happy face ! J'ride mon Happy day 
Jusqu'Ã  la Happy End. Happy face, happy face ...

Des kamikazes, des phases qui claquent quand on est archi fly man 
Dans nos habitacles que des clics clacs 
C'est banlieu sud-est amicale, n'est ce pas ? 
Reebok, Adidas, gratte des grasses mats, aucun Vespa 
ChÃ©rie on aime les doggies, les boules bombÃ©s 
On mÃ¨ne la fast-life on s'en fout d'tomber

Si y'a la BAC qui scrute on che-ca l'pilon 
On file, on ves-qui la prison, jetons l'mauvais, trions 
On prie chacun nos dieux, certains c'est Jack Daniels 
D'autres Kobe Bryant moi j'ai tatoue la Vierge 
On aime partager, mais garde ta Mortadelle 
On prÃ©fÃ¨re le colombo rougaÃ¯ piment meme s'il est fort sa mÃ¨re 
PÃ©ter le score ca m'plait 
J'parle en vrac de mes homies y'a peu d'corps d'athlÃ¨tes 
J'parait gore d'aspect mais rien a foutre j'ai des bornes Ã  faire 
Pour rÃ©unir ma troupe j'fuck l'attrait 
C'est la guerilla, sort de ta tess ou ton pavillon 
J'suis juste un gosse de la pÃ©riphÃ©rie parisienne 
 
Bande d'enfoirÃ©s 
Met l'son a fond dans ta caisse, cri : 
Bande d'enfoirÃ©s 
Faut qu'tu captes le truc avec ta : 
Bande d'enfoirÃ©s 
Le crew qui baffe le plus c'est ma : 
Bande d'enfoirÃ©s 
Tu sais qui me suis : 
Une Bande d'enfoirÃ©s

A2H,Dehors,"

Ca flaire la douille dehors, Ã§a sent la couille ma poule 
J'vais dÃ©bouler et foutre la frousse Ã  cette troupe de porcs 
J'suis un clichÃ© d'mon Ã©poque : dreadlocks, douille de drogue 
En cours j'y ai pas fait long feu, ca sentait l'pourri, l'mort 
Le monde est flippant, j'bousille le stock de taga c'es trippant 
Et Ã§a m'va ca a du sens pour moi, Ã©coute mon chant pour voir 
Tout est trop chiant Ã§a m'gave, Ãªtre sous l'chanvre Ã§a m'calme 
J'suis Ã  la bourre sur le monde, j'suis dans ma bulle 
Je me bousille 
J'esquive les machettes et les Uzi 
J'sais mÃªme pas oÃ¹ sont mes F.A.F qu'est ce qu'un P.E.L ? 
Pas loin des types qui vendent des traces, y'a rien d'personnel 
Oui j'reste fou, fabuleux pour certaines 
DÃ©jÃ  trop chialÃ©, d'la rage derriÃ¨re la caisse claire 
J'reste perplexe face au monde et j'fais ce texte 
Assis sur la ligne 7 entre les dealers et les teurs-inspect 
 
Dehors c'est bizarre, je m'y sens pas vraiment bien 
J'aimerais une vie oÃ¹ j'suis jamais en chien 
J'me bat pour ma gueule et ma famille 
MÃªme si demain j'fais mes valises 
 
Dehors c'est bizarre, je m'y sens pas vraiment bien 
J'aimerais une vie oÃ¹ j'suis jamais en chien 
J'me bat pour ma gueule et ma famille 
MÃªme si demain j'fais mes valises 
 
Les paplars ca m'rend ouf, j'me tire les veuch le soir 
J'esquive le pieu et l'pire c'est que j'me voile la face 
Et je nie les deux 
Devant le rire des ieuv, je plisse les yeux 
Et me demande s'il est possible de faire mieux 
Un ptit merdeux, le monde brÃ»le moi j'regarde des clips 
J'aimerais dÃ©fendre des causes, faire du sport, Ãªtre athlÃ©tique 
Mais j'finis par faire des rimes sur une ligne de basse 
Fumer des sticks, bossant mes titres avec ma click de naze 
J'suis bidon au yeux des plus instruis 
Parce que j'ai plus 15 piges et qu'fais un truc bizarre qui pu la street 
Mais j'm'en fou, j'fais kiffer les miens 
Ãa m'permet d'garder le smile et d'Ã©viter les seringues 
J'suis un mÃ©tisse qui a dÃ©jÃ  fait du chemin 
Un autiste qui a grattÃ© du refrain 
J'en ai tapÃ© du train, j'en ai croisÃ© du chien 
J'suis en proie, j'crois penser aux miens 
Ãa m'fait du bien, on verra ce qu'il advient 
 
Dehors c'est bizarre, je m'y sens pas vraiment bien 
J'aimerais une vie oÃ¹ j'suis jamais en chien 
J'me bat pour ma gueule et ma famille 
MÃªme si demain j'fais mes valises 
 
Larguez les bombes la jeunesse en a plus rien Ã  branler 
On a zappÃ© les leÃ§ons entre le sky et le dÃ©tail d'un 100G 
On a fait les cons, vesqui la crasse une fois la nuit tombÃ©e 
D'la re-pu, du bicarbonate Ã§a apprend vite Ã  compter 
Schlag, dope et soirÃ©e gratis 
La night gloque a cannÃ© ton fils 
Ca parle stone calÃ© dans l'vice 
Ca chiale Ã  la baraque t'as dÃ©jÃ  fumÃ© ton SMIC 
La BAC elle t'a marave tu vas encore jurer qu'on s'tire 
Mais demain ca sera la mÃªme merde 
J'serai toujours dans mes caisses claires, triste de l'air terne 
Et mes potes s'pÃ©terons toujours au Jack entre 2 vieilles fesses 
D'autres au chtar avec de l'herbe sÃ¨che, au grec avec de l'espÃ¨ce 
Des fois ca pu quand on prend du recul 
Des fois j'me sens seul, j'me sens nul en sortant du stud' 
Donc j'cogite avec mon shit et un double cheese 
Ma jeunesse crise, la rÃ©ussite en nous a peu d'estime

A2H,Mme Middle Class,"

Alors A2H on va revenir un peu sur tes origines 
Yes, ok, Ã§a roule 
Donc t'es nÃ© dans un HLM du MÃ©e-sur-Seine ? 
Yeah 
Et ensuite t'as bougÃ© un petit peu partout dans le Sud de la Seine et Marne, surtout du cÃ´tÃ© de Melun, c'est bien Ã§a ? 
Ouais c'est Ã§a en fait, j'ai jonglÃ© dans pleins d'apparts diffÃ©rents entre le MÃ©e, Melun, les villes alentours 
Juste avec ta mÃ¨re en fait ? 
Ouais, juste avec ma mÃ¨re, j'ai grandi seul avec ma mÃ¨re, j'suis le fils de la nana de l'accueil si tu vois ce que je veux dire. Je suis un enfant de cette Middle Class qui sert les fesses pour avoir le smile Ã  NoÃ«l 
 
Elle est lassÃ©e et cassÃ©e car elle taffe pour un SMIC 
Tire une barre sur un stick, puis rentre, zappe sur la 6 
Sale rengaine, des tas de problÃ¨mes, des petites aubaines 
Mais rien de fou, disons qu'elle veux vivre loin de l'hostile 
Finir au vert, avec 2 gosses, une piscine, un Range Rover 
Partir en vacances sur la cÃ´te Ouest en lisant Closer 
Les heures sup' pour les cadeaux des gosses 
MÃªme s'il est racho le boss, faut bien raquer : les impÃ´ts, le [?] 
La loque, les chaussures, la robe, le caddie Ã  Franprix 
Un gÃ¢teau pour les 30 piges. Des enfants peu attentifs 
Des heures, pensif, intensif est son train de vie 
Elle est souvent en chien de sou et se tire les tifs 
Se tire lessivÃ©e, replie les chemises et tise un litron 
S'Ã©tale sur le divan ivre devant Fifa et un syphon 
Tout Ã§a n'est pas si fou 
Immortelle ma Middle Class ne peut pas se dissoudre 
Je lui rend hommage dans ce discours 
 
Lutter contre tout Ã  s'en casser le dos 
Ne sert qu'Ã  se rajouter des hÃ©matomes 
Elle rentre dans le moule et prend la pose 
Ere dans la foule et prend sa dose 
Et quand Ã§a chauffe, bouge 
J'entend crier : ""Au Secours"" 
Des injures dans sa grosse bouche 
 
Mrs Middle Class 
You raised me and I'm thankful 
And I'm thankful 
Even thaugh I wish that I had it better with you 
Better with you 
Mrs Middle Class 
You hold me tight and make me feel good 
Make me feel so good 
Mrs Middle Class 
Mrs Middle Class 
 
Elle m'a donnÃ© un toit, elle m'a filÃ© Ã  grailler 
Elle m'a donnÃ© envie d'avoir mieux, l'envie de me tailler 
Elle a fait chialÃ© ma mÃ¨re mais on s'est jamais noyÃ© 
Elle a cernÃ© mes vices, mes kiffs, elle m'a vu aboyer 
Elle m'a fait comprend qu'on Ã©tait pas Ã  plaindre 
Y'a toujours plus en chien mais elle m'a fait passer ma vie dans le train 
AimÃ© l'entraide, cÃ´toyer des tas de communautÃ©s 
Avancer en paix, Ã  part elle jamais connu autre chose 
Elle m'a fait aimer le simple, mais m'a donnÃ© les crocs 
M'a fait haÃ¯r les grosses pinces, cÃ´toyer mÃ©chants et bons 
Je suis dans la masse et c'est beau 
Je suis au cÅur du truc, entre les minces et les gros, oui 
Le sale Ã©lÃ©gant, m'a fait rencontrÃ© des gens 
Certes des fois Ã©tranges 
Mme Middle Class : Merci encore 
Je sais que je suis, t'inquiÃ¨tes pas pour la suite 
Oui je resterai ton fils mÃªme si un jour je te quitte 
 
Lutter contre tout Ã  s'en casser le dos 
Ne sert qu'Ã  se rajouter des hÃ©matomes 
Elle rentre dans le moule et prend la pose 
Ere dans la foule et prend sa dose 
Et quand Ã§a chauffe, bouge 
J'entend crier : ""Au Secours"" 
Des injures dans sa grosse bouche 
 
Mrs Middle Class 
You raised me and I'm thankful 
And I'm thankful 
Even thaugh I wish that I had it better with you 
Better with you 
Mrs Middle Class 
You hold me tight and make me feel good 
Make me feel so good

A2H,Par Amour,"

Yeah, DidaÃ¯ Ã  la prod, ok ! 
A2 putain d'H et Monsieur Driver, on fait Ã§a par amour, enfoirÃ© 
 
J'met mes rognons sur la table et saigne Ã  coeur ouvert 
Si y'a du pognon sous la table, j'veux ma part Ã§a c'est clair 
Mais j'suis au dessus d'leurs lois et j'me fou d'leurs codes 
J'ai traversÃ© tout ces Ã©poques comme un MacLÃ©od 
Coup d'Ã©pÃ©e dans l'eau, quand l'public download 
Illicite comme Marlo, mais j'suis toujours la bro' ! 
C'est le naturel, je peux tout kicker par amour 
Repartir Ã  zÃ©ro : j'peux tout quitter par amour 
Le love Ã  la folie, j'peux te giffler par amour 
Point de non retour, je te dÃ©teste par amour 
Mentir comme un arracheur de dents 
Et toi tu gobes tout comme un aspirateur de glands 
J'suis dans ma rÃ©alitÃ©, mon fond d'solitude 
J'rÃ©partirais de ce game comme je suis venu 
DÃ©valant l'avenue avec un casque de walkman 
Marchant seul comme David Banner ou Jean-Jacques Goldman 
 
Ma grande histoire d'amour c'est celle avec mon rap 
C'est A2H et Driver on vit des tas d'contes-ra 
Avec passion oui c'est Ã§a l'contrat 
AprÃ¨s tout Ã§a je me demande putain mais qu'est ce qu'on ferra ? 
 
Ma grande histoire d'amour c'est celle avec mon rap 
C'est A2H et Driver on vit des tas d'contes-ra 
Avec passion oui c'est Ã§a l'contrat 
AprÃ¨s tout Ã§a je me demande putain mais qu'est ce qu'on ferra ? 
 
Je vis, je kiffe mon rap 
Quand j'livre aux types mes rythmes hostiles 
C'est vite so clean, j'exige qu'on tripe sans drames 
Par amour sans flingues, Ã  la douce sans seringues 
Tape pas la schnouf mon zing, non, viens Ã  la cool qu'on trinque ! 
A la santÃ© du mouvement, de notre banlieu de notre crew 
J'couche un track touchant pour te montrer que j'm'en fou du jeu 
Donc y'a du love pour la rime et que la foule fout l'feu 
J'aime la prod' j'y met du style et v'la une ptite douceur ! 
J'fais pas des titres tout cheum 
Le rap ma vie, sans Ã§a j'suis qui *ouai*, Ã  part un type tout seul ? 
Souvent tout triste sous skunk, seul la musique me pose 
J'Ã©vite les crises de seum, c'est plus qu'un kiff du coeur 
GÃ¨ne et quand j'kick : stupeur 
Dans les rÃ©tines j'suis juste un ptit du peuple 
Enfant des Ã®les, du centre ville, iÃ§i se fige mon oeuvre 
Premier album de l'amour dans les yeuz 
J'espÃ¨re tenir avec Ã§a si y'a pas d'flouz dans les keusses 
 
Ma grande histoire d'amour c'est celle avec mon rap 
C'est A2H et Driver on vit des tas d'contes-ra 
Avec passion oui c'est Ã§a l'contrat 
AprÃ¨s tout Ã§a je me demande putain mais qu'est ce qu'on ferra ?

AprÃ¨s tout Ã§a je me demande putain mais qu'est ce qu'on ferra ? 
 
J'rap sur toute sorte d'instru, faya tout les intrus 
Rase des tÃªtes, j'ai ton scalp ouai ouai encore un d'plus 
Si je faisais pas d'zik, bah j'ferais d'la zik 
SÃ©rieux et sÃ©vÃ¨re comme Vahid HalilhodÅ¾ic 
On peut m'avoir qu'une fois, dans tout les cas mais pas deux 
Music de love of my life, comme Erykah Badu 
Donc vivre sans sa femme serait une catastrophe 
J'aurais voulu qu'Biggie et Michael Ã©coutent mes strophes 
 
Yo ! J'suis dedans avec cette merde 
J'aime trop mon blues, j'aime trop ma soul j'suis dedans 
Oui c'est la course au succÃ¨s et la poussÃ©e des grands 
C'est par amour qu'on kiffe, qu'on brille, qu'on chante 
C'est A2H et Driver sort donc les filles et le champ' 
J'donne par amour, j'veux pas Ãªtre Ã  la bourre 
Pour faire manger ma troupe, lever la croupe avec mes you-voi 
J'oublie les pattes, j'oublie les phases hard 
J'oublie les garde av', maman ouai je veux qu'tu nous vois 
 
Ma grande histoire d'amour c'est celle avec mon rap 
C'est A2H et Driver on vit des tas d'contes-ra 
Avec passion oui c'est Ã§a l'contrat 
AprÃ¨s tout Ã§a je me demande putain mais qu'est ce qu'on ferra ?
